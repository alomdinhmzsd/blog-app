### Question 'SAA-Q001'

A healthcare company uses its on-premises infrastructure to run legacy applications that require specialized customizations to the underlying Oracle database as well as its host operating system (OS). The company also wants to improve the availability of the Oracle database layer. The company has hired you as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate to build a solution on AWS that meets these requirements while minimizing the underlying infrastructure maintenance effort.

**Which of the following options represents the best solution for this use case?**

- Deploy the Oracle database layer on multiple Amazon EC2 instances spread across two Availability Zones (AZs). This deployment configuration guarantees high availability and also allows the Database Administrator (DBA) to access and customize the database environment and the underlying operating system
- Leverage cross AZ read-replica configuration of Amazon RDS for Oracle that allows the Database Administrator (DBA) to access and customize the database environment and the underlying operating system
- **Leverage multi-AZ configuration of Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle that allows the Database Administrator (DBA) to access and customize the database environment and the underlying operating system**
- Leverage multi-AZ configuration of Amazon RDS for Oracle that allows the Database Administrator (DBA) to access and customize the database environment and the underlying operating system

### 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer**: **Leverage multi-AZ configuration of Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle that allows the Database Administrator (DBA) to access and customize the database environment and the underlying operating system**

| Option                                    | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy on EC2 across two AZs              | ❌ Incorrect | While EC2 provides full control, it requires the company to manage availability, patching, backups, and failovers manually—higher maintenance effort. |
| Cross-AZ read-replica with RDS for Oracle | ❌ Incorrect | Read replicas are for read scaling, not high availability or failover; also, RDS does not allow OS-level customization.                               |
| **Multi-AZ RDS Custom for Oracle**        | ✅ Correct   | RDS Custom allows customizations to OS and DB layer and supports Multi-AZ for automatic failover—best fit for legacy workloads.                       |
| Multi-AZ RDS for Oracle                   | ❌ Incorrect | While RDS with Multi-AZ supports HA, it does **not** allow OS or DB-level customizations needed for legacy applications.                              |

| Cross-AZ read replica           | Misleading—read replicas are not HA solutions, and RDS restricts customization. |
| RDS Custom with Multi-AZ        | Straightforward and correct.                                                    |
| Standard RDS Multi-AZ           | Appears valid for HA, but lacks necessary customization capabilities.           |

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Strategy**: Always match the _requirement for control_ (like OS/DB customization) with the _correct AWS service_. For managed databases, if control is needed → RDS Custom. If not → standard RDS.
- **Tip**: EC2 might offer flexibility but almost always fails on the “minimize maintenance” requirement.

| Minimized infrastructure maintenance  | AWS-managed service (not EC2)            |
| Supports regulated healthcare systems | RDS Custom (with control and compliance) |

---

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **RDS Custom for Oracle** bridges the gap between self-managed EC2 and fully managed RDS by offering administrative access to OS and DB binaries while still handling backups, monitoring, and HA.
- **Multi-AZ** for RDS Custom replicates the primary DB to a standby in another AZ, automatically failing over in case of a failure—ensuring high availability.
- **EC2 for databases** is viable only when deep customization is required _and_ the organization is willing to manage full lifecycle operations (patching, backups, HA, monitoring).
- Use RDS Custom for **legacy lift-and-shift** scenarios where database-level and OS-level control is non-negotiable, but operational burden must still be reduced.

### 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer**: **Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Kinesis**

| Option                                 | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon Gateway Endpoints, SQS, Kinesis | ❌ Incorrect | Gateway endpoints provide **private connectivity**, not throttling. SQS and Kinesis are valid buffering services.                  |
| ELB, SQS, Lambda                       | ❌ Incorrect | ELB doesn’t throttle or queue traffic in the same way API Gateway can. No native request-limiting logic in ELB.                    |
| SQS, SNS, Lambda                       | ❌ Incorrect | While event-driven, there's no **throttling control** via SNS. SNS fans out traffic; it doesn’t buffer or slow it down.            |
| **API Gateway, SQS, Kinesis**          | ✅ Correct   | API Gateway allows request throttling. SQS buffers discrete messages; Kinesis supports real-time streaming. Best combo for spikes. |

| Elastic Load Balancer       | Yes – commonly mistaken as a throttling mechanism, but it doesn't handle traffic bursts well |
| SNS                         | Yes – often paired with SQS/Lambda, but **not** used for throttling or buffering             |
| API Gateway + SQS + Kinesis | No – all three play distinct roles: throttle, queue, and stream                              |

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Strategy**: Isolate the purpose of each service:
  - API Gateway for **throttling**,
  - SQS/Kinesis for **buffering**,
  - Lambda for **event processing**.
- **Tip**: Be careful with services that sound similar (e.g., Gateway Endpoint vs API Gateway). Pay attention to use case verbs like “throttle”, “buffer”, and “stream”.

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CloudFront + DNS record on Route 53        | ❌ Incorrect | Adds unnecessary indirection. CloudFront can point directly to on-premises origin using its IP or domain—no need for Route 53 involvement here. |
| S3 + CRR                                   | ❌ Incorrect | This implies static content hosting and replication, but the requirement specifies a **dynamic website** and retaining backend in the US.       |
| Route 53 geo-proximity to on-prem servers  | ❌ Incorrect | Doesn’t improve latency or caching—simply adjusts routing logic. Backend remains the same; no edge acceleration is added.                       |
| **CloudFront + on-premises custom origin** | ✅ Correct   | CloudFront accelerates content delivery by caching content at edge locations closest to users in Asia—even when origin is still in the US.      |

| S3 CRR                        | High—uses a feature irrelevant for dynamic content and backend constraints.                            |
| Geo-proximity via Route 53    | High—often mistaken as a performance booster, but it only changes routing logic, not network behavior. |
| CloudFront with custom origin | Low—clearly correct and directly addresses latency and caching needs.                                  |

### Question 'SAA-Q012'

A digital wallet company plans to launch a new cloud-based service for processing user cash transfers and peer-to-peer payments. The application will receive transaction requests from mobile clients via a secure endpoint. Each transaction request must go through a lightweight validation step before being forwarded for backend processing, which includes fraud detection, ledger updates, and notifications. The backend workload is compute- and memory-intensive, requires scaling based on volume, and must run for a longer duration than typical short-lived tasks. The engineering team prefers a fully managed solution that minimizes infrastructure maintenance, including provisioning and patching of virtual machines or containers.

**Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?**

- Configure Amazon SQS to receive encrypted payment notifications from mobile devices. Use Amazon EventBridge rules to extract the payload and perform validation. Route the messages to a backend system hosted on Amazon Lightsail instances with dynamic scaling policies based on memory thresholds and instance health checks
- Create an Amazon API Gateway endpoint to receive transaction requests from mobile devices. Use AWS Lambda to validate the transactions. For backend processing, deploy the application on Amazon EKS Anywhere, running on on-premises servers in the company’s data center. Use a custom provisioning script to scale Kubernetes worker nodes based on transaction volume
- ✅ **Expose an Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoint to receive transaction requests from mobile clients. Integrate the API with AWS Lambda to perform basic validation. For backend processing, deploy the long-running application to Amazon ECS using the Fargate launch type, allowing ECS to manage compute and memory provisioning automatically, with no server management required**
- Build a REST API using Amazon API Gateway. Integrate it with an AWS Step Functions state machine for validation. Launch the backend application using Amazon EKS with self-managed nodes, and use Kubernetes Jobs to handle transaction processing workflows. Manually scale the cluster based on demand

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company wants to handle money transfers via a cloud app that starts with secure mobile requests, does a quick check, and then runs complex backend work like fraud detection. They want the setup to run **with minimal manual effort** and **without managing servers**. What AWS solution fits best?

### Question 'SAA-Q013'

A financial services company operates a containerized microservices architecture using Kubernetes in its on-premises data center. Due to strict industry regulations and internal security policies, all application data and workloads must remain physically within the on-premises environment. The company’s infrastructure team wants to modernize its Kubernetes stack and take advantage of AWS-managed services and APIs, including automated Kubernetes upgrades, Amazon CloudWatch integration, and access to AWS IAM features — but without migrating any data or compute resources to the cloud.

**Which AWS solution will best meet the company’s requirements for modernization while ensuring that all data remains on premises?**

- Deploy Amazon ECS with Fargate in a nearby AWS Local Zone. Use CloudWatch Logs to forward events to the primary region. Connect the Local Zone to the company’s data center over a VPN. Configure containers to pull data from on-premises storage through a mounted file share
- Use an AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized device to run EKS-compatible Docker containers on-site. Periodically export application logs and container snapshots to Amazon S3 using Snowball’s offline data transfer features. Use the Snowball console to orchestrate workloads in batches
- Set up a dedicated AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises environment and an AWS Region. Deploy Amazon EKS in the cloud and connect it to the local Kubernetes cluster. Use IAM roles and API Gateway to integrate authentication and traffic flow for hybrid workloads
- ✅ **Install an AWS Outposts rack in the company’s data center. Use Amazon EKS Anywhere on Outposts to run containerized workloads locally while integrating with AWS APIs**

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company wants to use AWS’s cool features (like CloudWatch, IAM, Kubernetes upgrades), **without moving any of their compute or data to the cloud** due to security laws. What AWS option lets them keep everything on-premises, but still gives them cloud-like management?

### Question 'SAA-Q016'

A technology blogger wants to write a review on the comparative pricing for various storage types available on AWS Cloud. The blogger has created a test file of size 1 gigabytes with some random data. Next he copies this test file into AWS S3 Standard storage class, provisions an Amazon EBS volume (General Purpose SSD (gp2)) with 100 gigabytes of provisioned storage and copies the test file into the Amazon EBS volume, and lastly copies the test file into an Amazon EFS Standard Storage filesystem. At the end of the month, he analyses the bill for costs incurred on the respective storage types for the test file.

**What is the correct order of the storage charges incurred for the test file on these three storage types?**

- Cost of test file storage on Amazon EFS < Cost of test file storage on Amazon S3 Standard < Cost of test file storage on Amazon EBS
- ✅ **Cost of test file storage on Amazon S3 Standard < Cost of test file storage on Amazon EFS < Cost of test file storage on Amazon EBS**
- Cost of test file storage on Amazon S3 Standard < Cost of test file storage on Amazon EBS < Cost of test file storage on Amazon EFS
- Cost of test file storage on Amazon EBS < Cost of test file storage on Amazon S3 Standard < Cost of test file storage on Amazon EFS

---

### 1. In Simple English

The blogger tested 3 types of AWS storage using a 1 GB file: S3 Standard, EBS (100 GB provisioned volume), and EFS. He wants to know which one ended up being the **cheapest to most expensive** based on AWS’s monthly charges.

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon S3** is object storage that charges per GB stored with very low cost, making it ideal for storing test data or infrequently accessed files.
- **Amazon EFS** is a managed file system with POSIX compliance but higher per-GB pricing; more suitable for shared file access patterns.
- **Amazon EBS** charges based on **provisioned volume**, not usage—so even if you use 1 GB out of 100 GB, you’re billed for all 100 GB.
- Always align your workload and budget to the billing model. **Provisioned storage** can create hidden costs in small-scale testing.

### Question 'SAA-Q022'

A healthcare analytics company centralizes clinical and operational datasets in an Amazon S3–based data lake. Incoming data is ingested in Apache Parquet format from multiple hospitals and wearable health devices. To ensure quality and standardization, the company applies several transformation steps: anomaly filtering, datetime normalization, and aggregation by patient cohort. The company needs a solution to support a code-free interface that enables data engineers and business analysts to collaborate on data preparation workflows. The company also requires data lineage tracking, data profiling capabilities, and an easy way to share transformation logic across teams without writing or managing code.

**Which AWS solution best meets these requirements?**

- ✅ **Use AWS Glue DataBrew to visually build transformation workflows on top of the raw Parquet files in S3. Use DataBrew recipes to track, audit, and share the transformation steps with others. Enable data profiling to inspect column statistics, null values, and data types across datasets**
- Use Amazon AppFlow to move and transform Parquet files in S3. Configure AppFlow transformations and mappings within the visual interface. Share flows with collaborators through AWS IAM policies and scheduled executions
- Create Amazon Athena SQL queries to perform transformation steps directly on S3. Store queries in AWS Glue Data Catalog and share saved queries with other users through Amazon Athena's query editor
- Use AWS Glue Studio’s visual canvas to design data transformation workflows on top of the Parquet files in Amazon S3. Configure Glue Studio jobs to run these transformations without writing code. Share the job definitions with team members for reuse. Use the visual job editor to track transformation progress and inspect profiling statistics for each dataset column

### Question 'SAA-Q024'

An e-commerce company manages a digital catalog of consumer products submitted by third-party sellers. Each product submission includes a description stored as a text file in an Amazon S3 bucket. These descriptions may include ingredient information for consumable products like snacks, supplements, or beverages. The company wants to build a fully automated solution that extracts ingredient names from the uploaded product descriptions and uses those names to query an Amazon DynamoDB table, which returns precomputed health and safety scores for each ingredient. Non-food items and invalid submissions can be ignored without affecting application logic. The company has no in-house machine learning (ML) experts and is looking for the most cost-effective solution with minimal operational overhead.

**Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?**

- Use Amazon SageMaker with a custom-trained NLP model to identify ingredients from the uploaded descriptions. Use Amazon EventBridge to invoke a Lambda function that forwards the document content to a SageMaker endpoint and stores the results in DynamoDB. Fine-tune the model using labeled ingredient datasets from open-source repositories and retrain it monthly
- Create a workflow where Amazon Transcribe is used to convert synthetic audio versions (created from text of the product descriptions) back into text. Analyze the transcripts manually or using simple keyword matching within a Lambda function. Use Amazon SNS to notify the content moderation team for each processed file
- Use Amazon Lookout for Vision to scan the uploaded text files in the S3 bucket and extract entities. Invoke this workflow using an S3-triggered Lambda function. Parse the output and use Amazon API Gateway to push updates to the frontend in real time
- ✅ **Configure S3 Event Notifications to trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever a new product description is uploaded. Inside the function, use Amazon Comprehend's custom entity recognition feature to extract ingredient names. Store these names in the DynamoDB table and let the front-end application query for health scores**

---

### 1. In Simple English

A company wants to automatically read ingredient names from text files uploaded to S3. Then, it should look up safety scores for each ingredient in DynamoDB. They want to avoid building ML models themselves and want a **cheap**, **easy**, and **fully automated** solution.

### Question 'SAA-Q026'

A retail company has developed a REST API which is deployed in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. The REST API stores the user data in Amazon DynamoDB and any static content, such as images, are served via Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). On analyzing the usage trends, it is found that 90% of the read requests are for commonly accessed data across all users.

**As a Solutions Architect, which of the following would you suggest as the MOST efficient solution to improve the application performance?**

- ✅ **Enable Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon CloudFront for Amazon S3**
- Enable ElastiCache Redis for DynamoDB and ElastiCache Memcached for Amazon S3
- Enable Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for Amazon DynamoDB and ElastiCache Memcached for Amazon S3
- Enable ElastiCache Redis for DynamoDB and Amazon CloudFront for Amazon S3

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company’s API is slow because 90% of the data is being read repeatedly. The user data comes from **DynamoDB**, and the images come from **S3**. You’re asked to recommend the **best caching solution** to speed things up and reduce backend strain.

### Question 'SAA-Q030'

A company is in the process of migrating its on-premises SMB file shares to AWS so the company can get out of the business of managing multiple file servers across dozens of offices. The company has 200 terabytes of data in its file servers. The existing on-premises applications and native Windows workloads should continue to have low latency access to this data which needs to be stored on a file system service without any disruptions after the migration. The company also wants any new applications deployed on AWS to have access to this migrated data.

**Which of the following is the best solution to meet this requirement?**

- Use Amazon FSx File Gateway to provide low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in Amazon EFS. The applications deployed on AWS can access this data directly from Amazon EFS
- Use Amazon Storage Gateway’s File Gateway to provide low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. The applications deployed on AWS can access this data directly from Amazon FSx in AWS
- Use AWS Storage Gateway’s File Gateway to provide low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in Amazon S3. The applications deployed on AWS can access this data directly from Amazon S3
- ✅ **Use Amazon FSx File Gateway to provide low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. The applications deployed on AWS can access this data directly from Amazon FSx in AWS**

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company wants to move **SMB-based file shares** to AWS but still allow **on-prem apps to use the files without slowdowns**. After the migration, both **on-prem and cloud apps** need access to the same files without changing how they interact with them.

### Question 'SAA-Q032'

A biotech research company needs to perform data analytics on real-time lab results provided by a partner organization. The partner stores these lab results in an Amazon RDS for MySQL instance within the partner’s own AWS account. The research company has a private VPC that does not have internet access, Direct Connect, or a VPN connection. However, the company must establish secure and private connectivity to the RDS database in the partner’s VPC. The solution must allow the research company to connect from its VPC while minimizing complexity and complying with data security requirements.

**Which solution will meet these requirements?**

- Set up VPC peering between the company’s VPC and the partner’s VPC. Use AWS Transit Gateway in the partner's account to route traffic from the company’s VPC to the database. Modify the RDS subnet route tables to allow access from the company’s CIDR block
- Instruct the partner to enable public access on the Amazon RDS instance and add a security group rule to allow inbound access from the company’s IP range. The company accesses the database over the public internet through a NAT Gateway configured in a private subnet
- Configure a client VPN endpoint in the company’s account. Have researchers connect to the VPN from their local machines. Establish a Direct Connect gateway to the partner’s VPC and route RDS traffic via this connection
- ✅ **Instruct the partner to create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the Amazon RDS for MySQL instance. Use AWS PrivateLink to expose the NLB as an interface VPC endpoint in the research company’s VPC**

---

### 1. In Simple English

The research company needs to **securely and privately access** a **partner's RDS MySQL database**. Their VPC has **no internet, no VPN, and no Direct Connect**, so you must find a **private, AWS-native way** to reach that database without opening it to the public.

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **AWS PrivateLink** allows **one-way, private access** to services in another VPC via **interface endpoints**.
- Since RDS **cannot natively support PrivateLink**, the workaround is to **place a Network Load Balancer in front of it**.
- The **partner account** creates the NLB and exposes it as a **PrivateLink service**. The research company creates an **interface endpoint** in their VPC to connect.
- This method ensures **no data ever leaves AWS**, meets **compliance**, **no internet**, and is **low complexity**.

### Question 'SAA-Q033'

A biotechnology firm runs genomics data analysis workloads using AWS Lambda functions deployed inside a VPC in their central AWS account. The input data for these workloads consists of large files stored in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) that resides in a separate AWS account managed by a research partner. The firm wants the Lambda function in their account to access the shared EFS storage directly. The access pattern and file volume are expected to grow as additional research datasets are added over time, so the solution must be scalable and cost-efficient, and should require minimal operational overhead.

**Which solution best meets these requirements in the MOST cost-effective way?**

- Set up an Amazon S3 bucket in the research partner’s account and periodically copy EFS contents into the bucket using scheduled AWS DataSync jobs. Use Amazon S3 Access Points to expose the data to the Lambda function in the central account, allowing access via S3 API calls instead of file system mounts
- ✅ **Use Amazon EFS resource policies to allow cross-account access to the file system from the central account. Attach the EFS mount target to a shared VPC or peered VPC, and mount the file system in the Lambda function configuration using an EFS access point**
- Package the genomic input data as a Lambda layer and publish it in the research partner's account. Share the layer across accounts by modifying its resource policy and attach the layer to the Lambda function in the central account to access the data during execution
- Create a second Lambda function in the research partner's account that mounts the EFS file system locally. Have the main Lambda function in the central account invoke this secondary Lambda via Amazon API Gateway for data access and computation. Use IAM cross-account permissions to allow invocation

---

### 1. In Simple English

A biotech firm has **Lambda functions in one AWS account**, and the genomics data they need is in **Amazon EFS in another account**. They want to **access the EFS directly from Lambda**, keep things **simple, scalable**, and **avoid extra costs or complex workarounds**.

### Question 'SAA-Q034'

A retail analytics company operates a large-scale data lake on Amazon S3, where they store daily logs of customer transactions, product views, and inventory updates. Each morning, they need to transform and load the data into a data warehouse to support fast analytical queries. The company also wants to enable data analysts to build and train machine learning (ML) models using familiar SQL syntax without writing custom Python code. The architecture must support massively parallel processing (MPP) for fast data aggregation and scoring, and must use serverless AWS services wherever possible to reduce infrastructure management and operational overhead.

**Which solution best meets these requirements?**

- Provision and run a daily Amazon EMR cluster with Apache Spark to process and transform the S3 data. Load the results into Amazon Redshift (provisioned). Enable ML model development by integrating Redshift with Amazon SageMaker notebooks for advanced modeling tasks
- ✅ **Use a daily AWS Glue job to transform and clean the data stored in Amazon S3. Load the transformed dataset into Amazon Redshift Serverless, which offers MPP capabilities in a serverless model. Enable analysts to use Amazon Redshift ML to build and train ML models**
- Run a daily AWS Glue job to process and transform the raw files in S3 and register the outputs as Amazon Athena tables in AWS Glue Data Catalog. Allow analysts to build ML models using Amazon Athena ML, with SQL-based predictions on top of S3 data without moving it to a warehouse
- Use an AWS Glue job to transform and load data into Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. Allow analysts to run machine learning models using Amazon Aurora ML integrated with PostgreSQL, leveraging Amazon SageMaker endpoints behind the scenes

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company wants a **serverless solution** to:

- Clean data from S3
- Run **fast analytics using MPP**
- Build ML models using **SQL** (not Python)
  The right answer should combine **AWS Glue**, **Amazon Redshift Serverless**, and **Redshift ML**.

### Question 'SAA-Q037'

An IT company wants to review its security best-practices after an incident was reported where a new developer on the team was assigned full access to Amazon DynamoDB. The developer accidentally deleted a couple of tables from the production environment while building out a new feature.

**Which is the MOST effective way to address this issue so that such incidents do not recur?**

- ✅ **Use permissions boundary to control the maximum permissions employees can grant to the IAM principals**
- Remove full database access for all IAM users in the organization
- The CTO should review the permissions for each new developer's IAM user so that such incidents don't recur
- Only root user should have full database access in the organization

---

### 1. In Simple English

A developer accidentally deleted production DynamoDB tables because they had **too many permissions**. The best way to fix this is to use a **permissions boundary** so no IAM user or role can ever get more access than what the security team allows—**even by mistake**.

| Permissions boundary    | Low – Best-practice answer that AWS officially recommends.                           |
| Remove all access       | Medium – Appears safe, but it's not a scalable or practical solution.                |
| CTO reviews permissions | High – Sounds responsible but impractical at scale and not a preventive mechanism.   |
| Root-only access        | High – Misleading. AWS **strongly discourages** root usage outside of account setup. |

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Strategy**: Look for **preventive** and **scalable** IAM controls (like SCPs or permissions boundaries) over **manual reviews or reactive solutions**.
- **Tip**: IAM permissions boundaries help teams **safely delegate IAM responsibilities** without risking over-permissioning.

| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Prevent over-permissioning    | Use IAM permissions boundaries          |
| Minimize operational risk     | Enforce guardrails through policies     |
| Avoid root usage              | Root only for account setup/emergencies |
| Scale IAM management securely | Delegate with safe constraints          |

---

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Permissions boundaries** act like **IAM guardrails**: even if a policy grants broad permissions, boundaries **limit what’s truly effective**.
- This enables **safe delegation** of IAM policy creation (e.g., to project teams or CI/CD systems) while still **enforcing security constraints** centrally.
- Unlike SCPs (which apply at the org/account level), **permissions boundaries work at the IAM principal level**—perfect for developer access control.

### Question 'SAA-Q040'

The sourcing team at the US headquarters of a global e-commerce company is preparing a spreadsheet of the new product catalog. The spreadsheet is saved on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) created in `us-east-1` region. The sourcing team counterparts from other AWS regions such as Asia Pacific and Europe also want to collaborate on this spreadsheet.

**As a solutions architect, what is your recommendation to enable this collaboration with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?**

- The spreadsheet on the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) can be accessed in other AWS regions by using an inter-region VPC peering connection
- ✅ **The spreadsheet will have to be copied in Amazon S3 which can then be accessed from any AWS region**
- The spreadsheet data will have to be moved into an Amazon RDS for MySQL database which can then be accessed from any AWS region
- The spreadsheet will have to be copied into Amazon EFS file systems of other AWS regions as Amazon EFS is a regional service and it does not allow access from other AWS regions

---

### 1. In Simple English

Amazon EFS is **regional**, so users in other regions can’t access it directly. The **simplest way** to share a file like a spreadsheet across regions is to **copy it to Amazon S3**, which is **globally accessible** and incurs **minimal overhead**.

### Question 'SAA-Q042'

A logistics company is building a multi-tier application to track the location of its trucks during peak operating hours. The company wants these data points to be accessible in real-time in its analytics platform via a REST API. The company has hired you as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate to build a multi-tier solution to store and retrieve this location data for analysis.

**Which of the following options addresses the given use case?**

- Leverage Amazon Athena with Amazon S3
- ❌ Leverage Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda
- ✅ **Leverage Amazon API Gateway with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics**
- Leverage Amazon QuickSight with Amazon Redshift

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company needs a system where:

- Trucks send **real-time location updates**
- Data is received through an **API**
- The analytics platform can **process and query** this location data **as it arrives**

This makes **Amazon API Gateway** (to expose the API) and **Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics** (to analyze streaming data in real-time) the best solution.

### Question 'SAA-Q045'

While consolidating logs for the weekly reporting, a development team at an e-commerce company noticed that an unusually large number of illegal AWS application programming interface (API) queries were made sometime during the week. Due to the off-season, there was no visible impact on the systems. However, this event led the management team to seek an automated solution that can trigger near-real-time warnings in case such an event recurs.

**Which of the following represents the best solution for the given scenario?**

- Run Amazon Athena SQL queries against AWS CloudTrail log files stored in Amazon S3 buckets. Use Amazon QuickSight to generate reports for managerial dashboards
- ✅ **Create an Amazon CloudWatch metric filter that processes AWS CloudTrail logs having API call details and looks at any errors by factoring in all the error codes that need to be tracked. Create an alarm based on this metric's rate to send an Amazon SNS notification to the required team**
- Configure AWS CloudTrail to stream event data to Amazon Kinesis. Use Amazon Kinesis stream-level metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch to trigger an AWS Lambda function that will trigger an error workflow
- AWS Trusted Advisor publishes metrics about check results to Amazon CloudWatch. Create an alarm to track status changes for checks in the Service Limits category for the APIs. The alarm will then notify when the service quota is reached or exceeded

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company saw a suspicious spike in API calls and wants **automated alerts** next time this happens. The best way to detect such behavior is by **monitoring CloudTrail logs for specific API patterns or errors** and triggering a **real-time CloudWatch alarm**.

### Question 'SAA-Q058'

An e-commerce company is looking for a solution with high availability, as it plans to migrate its flagship application to a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. The solution should allow for content-based routing as part of the architecture.

**As a Solutions Architect, which of the following will you suggest for the company?**

- ✅ **Use an Application Load Balancer for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure Auto Scaling group to mask any failure of an instance**

- Use an Auto Scaling group for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure an elastic IP address (EIP) to mask any failure of an instance

- Use a Network Load Balancer for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure a Private IP address to mask any failure of an instance

- Use an Auto Scaling group for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure a Public IP address to mask any failure of an instance

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company needs a **highly available EC2-based solution** that also supports **content-based routing** (e.g., route traffic based on URL path like `/api` or `/images`). This means the routing layer must be smart enough to inspect the request content and forward it accordingly.

| **Application Load Balancer + Auto Scaling** | ✅ Correct   | ALB supports Layer 7 content-based routing (URL/path/host). Auto Scaling spreads instances across AZs and replaces failed ones.    |
| **Auto Scaling + Elastic IP**                | ❌ Incorrect | Auto Scaling alone doesn’t route traffic; an EIP cannot distribute traffic across instances or provide content-based routing       |
| **Network Load Balancer + Private IP**       | ❌ Incorrect | NLB works at Layer 4 (TCP), does **not** support content-based routing                                                             |
| **Auto Scaling + Public IP**                 | ❌ Incorrect | Public IPs are not resilient and don’t solve routing; no load balancer involved means no traffic distribution or content-awareness |

---

### 5. Final Answer

✅ **Use an Application Load Balancer for distributing traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances spread across different Availability Zones (AZs). Configure Auto Scaling group to mask any failure of an instance**

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **ALB = Layer 7** → Use for **path/host-based routing**
- **NLB = Layer 4** → Use for **TCP-level** performance and static IP needs
- **Auto Scaling** is for **horizontal scaling & failover**, **not for routing**
- **IP addresses (public, private, elastic)** are **not routing mechanisms**

| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| High availability       | Auto Scaling across AZs   |
| Content-based routing   | Application Load Balancer |
| No manual IP management | Use load balancer DNS     |

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **ALBs** allow intelligent traffic routing based on **host header**, **path**, **query string**, etc.
- **Auto Scaling groups** integrate natively with ALBs to distribute and replace instances seamlessly.
- **High availability** in AWS means spreading across **at least two AZs** with **failover mechanisms**.
- Misusing **EIPs or static IPs** for load distribution is ineffective and not scalable.

### Question 'SAA-Q061'

The flagship application for a gaming company connects to an Amazon Aurora database and the entire technology stack is currently deployed in the United States. Now, the company has plans to expand to Europe and Asia for its operations. It needs the **games table** to be **accessible globally** but needs the **users** and **games_played** tables to be **regional only**.

**How would you implement this with minimal application refactoring?**

- Use an Amazon DynamoDB global table for the games table and use Amazon Aurora for the users and games_played tables

- Use an Amazon Aurora Global Database for the games table and use Amazon DynamoDB tables for the users and games_played tables

- Use an Amazon DynamoDB global table for the games table and use Amazon DynamoDB tables for the users and games_played tables

- ✅ **Use an Amazon Aurora Global Database for the games table and use Amazon Aurora for the users and games_played tables**

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company needs **global access** to one database table (`games`) and **local (regional) access** to two others (`users`, `games_played`). They want to achieve this **without changing their existing Aurora-based architecture** too much.

| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aurora Global Database            | Ensures global read access with regional write isolation        |
| DynamoDB Global Table             | NoSQL solution; needs app logic changes if replacing Aurora     |
| Hybrid Architecture Understanding | Whether user knows how to separate global and regional concerns |
| Minimizing Refactoring            | Emphasizes maintaining Aurora for regional tables               |

### 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:**  
**Use an Amazon Aurora Global Database for the games table and use Amazon Aurora for the users and games_played tables**

| Option                                                            | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aurora Global DB for games; Aurora for users and games_played** | ✅ Correct   | This minimizes refactoring. Keeps the current Aurora architecture and uses Aurora Global DB to make `games` table globally available. |
| **DynamoDB global for games; Aurora for others**                  | ❌ Incorrect | Would require app to refactor schema and logic to support DynamoDB data model                                                         |
| **Aurora Global for games; DynamoDB for others**                  | ❌ Incorrect | Mixes Aurora with DynamoDB unnecessarily; also forces DynamoDB adoption for regional data                                             |
| **DynamoDB global for games; DynamoDB for others**                | ❌ Incorrect | Fully transitions to NoSQL, which contradicts “minimal refactoring” of existing Aurora stack                                          |

### 5. Final Answer

✅ **Use an Amazon Aurora Global Database for the games table and use Amazon Aurora for the users and games_played tables**

| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aurora Global for global; Aurora for regional | Low              | Clearly aligns with use case and requires least change            |
| DynamoDB global + Aurora regional             | Medium           | Hybrid approach but introduces data model mismatch                |
| Aurora global + DynamoDB regional             | High             | Mixes paradigms without compelling reason                         |
| Fully DynamoDB                                | High             | Major rewrite; not aligned with “minimal refactoring” requirement |

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Stick to existing stack** if the question emphasizes **minimal change**
- **Aurora Global DB** = good for **read-mostly, globally available data**
- **DynamoDB** is great for scale, but needs **NoSQL schema** and logic changes
- Match **data access pattern** with **database type**: global ≠ regional

| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Global accessibility for `games`               | Aurora Global Database                           |

| Minimal refactoring                            | ✅ Achieved with Aurora Global + regional Aurora |

---

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon Aurora Global Database** is ideal for **globally shared but read-mostly datasets** like a `games` catalog.
- **Regional tables** like `users` and `games_played` benefit from **write-locality** and can remain in regular Aurora deployments.
- **DynamoDB** is fantastic for global applications but requires different data modeling and code logic — it’s not a drop-in replacement for Aurora.
