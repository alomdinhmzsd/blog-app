## üß≠ HPC Strategy on AWS: Patterns

1. **Tightly Coupled Workloads (MPI-based)**
   ‚Üí Use EC2 + EFA + Cluster Placement Group + FSx for Lustre

2. **Loosely Coupled/Embarrassingly Parallel Workloads**
   ‚Üí Use AWS Batch + EC2 Spot + S3

3. **Managed Clusters**
   ‚Üí Use **AWS ParallelCluster** for provisioning and orchestration

4. **On-demand Supercomputing**
   ‚Üí Combine EC2 HPC instances with FSx, EFA, and Batch to simulate supercomputer performance without upfront hardware cost
