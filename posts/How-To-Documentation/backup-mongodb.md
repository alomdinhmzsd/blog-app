Perfect — everything looks great! ✅

### ✅ Next Step: Back Up Your `project-2nd-library` Database

Here’s the command to back it up:

```bash
mongodump --db=project-2nd-library --out=/Volumes/LaCie/backups/project-2nd-library-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

This will create a folder like:

```
/Volumes/LaCie/backups/project-2nd-library-20250323/project-2nd-library/
```

All your video, book, and chapter records will be safely dumped in BSON/JSON format.

---

### ⏪ To Restore (if needed later):

```bash
mongorestore --db=project-2nd-library /Volumes/LaCie/backups/project-2nd-library-20250323/project-2nd-library
```

---

Let me know once the backup is complete, and I’ll help you run the fix script for the `"inf_inf"` chapter IDs.
