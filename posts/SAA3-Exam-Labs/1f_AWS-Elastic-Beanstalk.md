You're absolutely right! The **AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate (SAA-C03)** exam doesn't go deep into **advanced Lambda integrations** like Step Functions, Rekognition, or AI services. Since we've already covered **IAM, EC2, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Lambda**, the next big focus should be **Elastic Beanstalk**.

## âœ… **Next Lab: AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

This lab will help you understand **Elastic Beanstalk (EB)**, which is crucial for the SAA exam. We'll cover:

### **ðŸ”¥ Lab Plan**

1. **Step 1: Deploy a simple web app using Elastic Beanstalk**

   - Launch an **Elastic Beanstalk environment** with a sample application.
   - Use the **AWS CLI** and **Elastic Beanstalk Management Console**.

2. **Step 2: Customize the environment**

   - Modify environment variables and instance types.
   - Add load balancing and auto-scaling.

3. **Step 3: Deploy a custom application**

   - Upload a sample **Flask (Python) or Node.js** application.
   - Deploy it via the **AWS CLI**.

4. **Step 4: Environment scaling & monitoring**

   - Adjust Auto Scaling settings.
   - Monitor logs and health status.

5. **Step 5: Cleanup**
   - Remove the environment to avoid unwanted costs.

Python (Flask) might be easier since you've worked with it before, but I'm happy to guide you with Node.js if you'd like.

### âœ… **Step 1: Initialize Elastic Beanstalk (`eb init`)**

This step will configure your project for AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites**

Before running `eb init`, ensure:

- You're in the root directory of your Flask project.
- You have AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`).
- `eb --version` works without errors.

---

### **ðŸš€ Initialize Elastic Beanstalk**

Run the following command in your Flask project directory:

```sh
eb init
```

**What happens next?**

1. **Select a region**: Choose your AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
2. **Choose a platform**: Select `Python` (for Flask).
3. **Set up SSH**: Youâ€™ll be asked whether to set up SSH (optional).

---

### **ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps**

Once `eb init` is complete, you can:

- **Deploy a Flask app (`eb create`)**.
- **Modify configurations (`eb config`)**.
- **View logs (`eb logs`)**.

Try running `eb init`, and let me know if you hit any issues! ðŸš€
