That‚Äôs a fantastic idea! A quiz app project like that would hit multiple AWS services and reinforce everything you‚Äôve learned. Here‚Äôs how it could align with the exam and the Well-Architected Framework pillars:

---

### ‚úÖ **What You‚Äôd Cover in This Project**

#### üåê **Hosting + Frontend (S3, Route 53, CloudFront)**

- Use **S3** to host the static frontend.
- Set up a custom domain with **Route 53**.
- Add **CloudFront** as a CDN for speed and security.
- Enable **HTTPS with ACM** (SSL/TLS certificate).

#### üß† **Backend (Node.js on EC2 or Lambda)**

- Either host a Node.js API on **EC2** (for practice with compute + monitoring),
- Or use **Lambda + API Gateway** (for serverless, cost-effective design).

#### üßæ **Database (DynamoDB or RDS)**

- Store quiz questions, user scores, etc.
- Use **DynamoDB** for low-maintenance, serverless.
- Or **RDS** if you want to practice relational DB setup.

#### üîí **Security (IAM, WAF, S3 policies)**

- Lock down your S3 bucket with least privilege.
- Use **IAM roles/policies** for Lambda or EC2.
- Add **WAF** to protect your app from bad traffic.

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Automation (CloudFormation)**

- Define the infrastructure as JSON or YAML.
- Make deployment repeatable and auditable.

#### üìà **Monitoring & Cost Optimization (CloudWatch, Budgets)**

- Set up **alarms** for Lambda/EC2 usage.
- Use **Cost Explorer** or **Budgets** to stay within free tier.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Why It‚Äôs Great for Review

- Covers **every major domain** on the exam.
- Lets you apply **Well-Architected Framework** concepts (especially security, cost, reliability).
- Builds something tangible you can reuse or show off.
- Helps reinforce **both Console and IaC** (CloudFormation).

If you‚Äôre ready, I can help you start planning the architecture and break it into steps ‚Äî starting with a basic S3-hosted frontend and scaling from there. Would you like to sketch out the first version together?

Awesome! This is a perfect capstone project to reinforce everything you‚Äôve learned for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate exam. You‚Äôll get to revisit all the core services and apply them in a real-world use case. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll break it down:

---

<h5> üéØ **Project Goal:**</h5>

Build a **Quiz Web App** using **HTML, CSS, Node.js** and host it as a static website on **S3**, secured with **SSL**, and accessed via a custom domain using **Route 53** + **CloudFront**.

### ‚úÖ **Tech Stack and AWS Services Used:**

| Component          | Service / Stack                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Frontend UI        | HTML + CSS (static files)                 |
| Backend API        | Node.js (Lambda or EC2/Elastic Beanstalk) |
| Hosting (Frontend) | Amazon S3 (Static Website Hosting)        |
| Custom Domain      | Route 53 (DNS) + ACM (SSL Certificate)    |
| CDN                | CloudFront (Caching + HTTPS)              |
| Infrastructure     | CloudFormation                            |
| Optional Logging   | CloudWatch, AWS Config, GuardDuty         |

### üõ†Ô∏è **Phased Deployment Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Static Website Hosting on S3**

1. Create an S3 bucket with public access disabled.
2. Upload HTML/CSS files.
3. Enable static website hosting.
4. Test via default S3 endpoint.

#### **Phase 2: Add a Custom Domain with Route 53**

1. Register a domain (or use an existing one).
2. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53.
3. Point your domain to the S3 static hosting endpoint.

#### **Phase 3: Add HTTPS with CloudFront + ACM**

1. Request a free public SSL certificate via ACM.
2. Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to your S3 bucket.
3. Attach your SSL cert.
4. Update Route 53 to point to the CloudFront distribution.

#### **Phase 4: Backend Integration (Optional)**

If you want to add server logic:

- **Option A**: Use Lambda + API Gateway
- **Option B**: Deploy Node.js on EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk

#### **Phase 5: Infrastructure as Code**

Write a CloudFormation template to create:

- S3 bucket
- Route 53 record
- CloudFront distribution
- SSL Certificate
- Optional backend services
