### Question 'SAA-Q301'

As a Solutions Architect, you are tasked to design a distributed application that will run on various EC2 instances. This application needs to have the highest performance local disk to cache data. Also, data is copied through an EC2 to EC2 replication mechanism. It is acceptable if the instance loses its data when stopped or terminated.

Which storage solution do you recommend?

- Instance Store
- Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

---

## 1. In Simple English

You’re building an EC2-based app that temporarily caches data on disk. The most important thing is **disk speed**, and **data loss is okay** if an instance shuts down. You want the **fastest local storage**.

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: Instance Store**

| Option             | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance Store** | ✅ Correct   | Instance Store is physically attached to the host, offering **very high IOPS and throughput**. It’s ephemeral, so data is lost when the instance is stopped, which is fine in this scenario. |
| **Amazon EFS**     | ❌ Incorrect | EFS is network-attached and shared, optimized for multi-instance access—not local caching or high-speed storage.                                                                             |
| **Amazon S3**      | ❌ Incorrect | S3 is object storage, not a local disk. It’s great for durable, shared storage but too slow for high-performance caching.                                                                    |
| **Amazon EBS**     | ❌ Incorrect | EBS is block-level storage, network-attached. While durable and good for most workloads, it’s **slower than Instance Store** for local caching needs.                                        |

## 5. Final Answer

✅ **Instance Store**

| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EBS            | ✅ Yes     | Many assume EBS is the best by default, but it's not fastest for local caching |
| EFS            | ✅ Yes     | Appears suitable due to shared access, but it’s not optimized for performance  |
| S3             | ✅ Yes     | Durable, but not meant for disk-like caching                                   |
| Instance Store | ❌ No      | Exactly fits the requirements of ephemeral, high-speed local disk              |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- Focus on **keywords** like: _"fastest local disk"_, _"acceptable to lose data"_.
- When performance is more important than durability, go with **Instance Store**.
- If shared access or durability is needed, consider **EBS/EFS/S3**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Multi-AZ with automatic failover** in Amazon ElastiCache Redis provides **automated detection** of primary node failure and promotes a replica seamlessly.
- Redis read replicas are **read-only** and cannot be **auto-promoted** in AWS — so they aren’t suitable for failover.
- **Snapshots** are helpful for backup purposes, not real-time availability.
- AOF (Append Only File) is a Redis-native durability mechanism, but not AWS-native and not commonly used in **ElastiCache-managed** setups.

### Question 'SAA-Q305'

As an e-sport tournament hosting company, you have servers that need to scale and be highly available. Therefore you have deployed an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) with an Auto Scaling group (ASG) across 3 Availability Zones (AZs). When e-sport tournaments are running, the servers need to scale quickly. And when tournaments are done, the servers can be idle. As a general rule, you would like to be highly available, have the capacity to scale and optimize your costs.

What do you recommend? (Select two)

- Use Dedicated hosts for the minimum capacity
- Set the minimum capacity to 3
- Set the minimum capacity to 1
- Use Reserved Instances for the minimum capacity
- Set the minimum capacity to 2

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're running tournament servers that need to:

- Scale fast during events
- Remain **highly available**
- Save money during idle times

You’re asked to pick two smart settings that meet **all three goals**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Auto Scaling Groups** spread instances across Availability Zones for fault tolerance.
- You don’t need one instance per AZ for **HA** — **two across two AZs** is sufficient.
- **Reserved Instances** should be used for any **always-running** resources — such as minimum ASG capacity — to **cut EC2 costs by up to 72%**.
- **Dedicated Hosts** are only suitable when you must control physical tenancy or comply with software licensing rules — **not needed here**.

### Question 'SAA-Q306'

A company has developed a popular photo-sharing website using a serverless pattern on the AWS Cloud using API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The backend uses an RDS PostgreSQL database. The website is experiencing high read traffic and the Lambda functions are putting an increased read load on the RDS database.

The architecture team is planning to increase the read throughput of the database, without changing the application's core logic. As a Solutions Architect, what do you recommend?

- Use Amazon DynamoDB
- Use Amazon RDS Multi-AZ feature
- Use Amazon RDS Read Replicas
- Use Amazon ElastiCache

---

- **RDS Read Replicas** allow offloading read traffic to one or more replicas to scale database **read performance**.
- They use **asynchronous replication**, so they are slightly behind the primary but ideal for **eventual consistency reads**.
- **Multi-AZ** is for **availability**, not performance — it maintains a standby instance that can't serve traffic until failover.
- **ElastiCache** provides fast in-memory caching but requires app logic to utilize it, such as caching queries or responses.
- **DynamoDB** is a NoSQL database and would require a **complete data model refactor**, which violates the scenario's constraint of no logic changes.

### Question 'SAA-Q307'

A leading e-commerce company runs its IT infrastructure on AWS Cloud. The company has a batch job running at 7 am daily on an RDS database. It processes shipping orders for the past day, and usually gets around 2000 records that need to be processed **sequentially** in a batch job via a shell script. The processing of each record takes about 3 seconds.

What platform do you recommend to run this batch job?

- AWS Glue
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
- Amazon EC2

---

## 1. In Simple English

You have a **daily batch job** that processes 2000 records one by one from an RDS database. Each one takes about 3 seconds, so the whole thing takes around **1.5 hours**. What AWS service is the best fit to run this **sequential, long-duration job**?

### Question 'SAA-Q310'

A development team has configured an Elastic Load Balancer for host-based routing. The idea is to support multiple subdomains and different top-level domains.

The rule `*.example.com` matches which of the following?

- EXAMPLE.COM
- example.com
- example.test.com
- test.example.com

---

## 1. In Simple English

The team is using host-based routing rules in an Application Load Balancer (ALB). They’ve written a rule like `*.example.com`. You’re asked to identify which hostnames match this pattern.

## 2. Verbiage & Realism

| Aspect                    | Evaluation                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Realistic Use Case?       | ✅ Yes — many companies use ALB to route traffic to multiple subdomains |
| Ambiguous Wording?        | ❌ No — pattern syntax is clearly defined                               |
| AWS Terminology Accurate? | ✅ Yes — accurately refers to host-based routing                        |

| Host-based routing pattern matching | Understanding how ALB rules interpret domain wildcards                 |
| DNS pattern rules vs exact matches  | Must know the difference between `*`, exact, and subdomain hierarchy   |
| Case sensitivity                    | DNS names are case-insensitive, but match rules are still string-based |

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: test.example.com**

| Option               | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EXAMPLE.COM**      | ❌ Incorrect | DNS is case-insensitive, but `EXAMPLE.COM` is a root domain and does not have a subdomain — it doesn’t match `*.example.com` |
| **example.com**      | ❌ Incorrect | `*.example.com` does **not** match the apex domain (no subdomain prefix)                                                     |
| **example.test.com** | ❌ Incorrect | This is a subdomain of `test.com`, not `example.com`.                                                                        |
| **test.example.com** | ✅ Correct   | Matches the pattern `*.example.com` — it is a subdomain of `example.com`                                                     |

## 5. Final Answer

✅ **test.example.com**

## 7. Are the Options Tricky?

| Option           | Trickiness | Why It's Tricky                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EXAMPLE.COM      | ✅ Yes     | Looks like it might match due to case or domain, but no subdomain prefix |
| example.com      | ✅ Yes     | Apex domains never match `*.` wildcards                                  |
| example.test.com | ✅ Yes     | Looks similar, but it’s not a child of `example.com`                     |
| test.example.com | ❌ No      | Straightforward match for the wildcard rule                              |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- Focus on the domain hierarchy: `*.example.com` matches `foo.example.com`, not `example.com` or nested domains like `bar.foo.example.com`
- Ignore case: DNS is case-insensitive
- Remember: Wildcard only matches **immediate subdomains**, not the root domain

## 9. Technology Deep Dive

| Rule Pattern      | Matches               | Does Not Match                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `*.example.com`   | `test.example.com`    | `example.com`, `example.test.com` |
| `*.*.example.com` | `foo.bar.example.com` | `bar.example.com`                 |
| `example.com`     | `example.com`         | `test.example.com`                |

## 10. Summary Table

| Condition          | Match? |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| `EXAMPLE.COM`      | ❌ No  |
| `example.com`      | ❌ No  |
| `example.test.com` | ❌ No  |
| `test.example.com` | ✅ Yes |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **ALB host-based rules** use **wildcard patterns** that must match the **fully qualified domain name (FQDN)** structure.
- The wildcard `*` in `*.example.com` matches **exactly one label** to the left of `example.com`.
- This means:
  - `test.example.com` ✅ valid
  - `example.com` ❌ invalid
  - `foo.bar.example.com` ❌ invalid
- Matching is **not recursive** and does not span multiple domain levels unless explicitly defined.
