## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:** `Consolidated billing has not been enabled`

| Option                                  | Verdict      | Detailed Reasoning                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Used for custom servers outside AWS** | ❌ Incorrect | Shield Advanced **only protects AWS resources** (e.g., EC2, ALB, CloudFront). External servers are **not supported**.                                                    |
| **Consolidated billing not enabled**    | ✅ Correct   | Without consolidated billing, Shield Advanced charges **$3,000/month per account**. Enabling it reduces this to **$3,000/month for all accounts** under an Organization. |
| **Also covers AWS Shield Standard**     | ❌ Incorrect | Shield Advanced includes Standard’s features but doesn’t "cost more" because of it – Standard is free.                                                                   |
| **Savings Plans not enabled**           | ❌ Incorrect | Savings Plans **do not apply** to Shield Advanced (fixed $3,000/month fee).                                                                                              |

## 7. Are the Options Tricky?

| Option                          | Why It’s Tricky                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Custom servers outside AWS      | Plausible if unaware of Shield Advanced’s AWS-only scope.                 |
| Shield Advanced covers Standard | Misleading – implies a cost relationship where none exists.               |
| Savings Plans not enabled       | Sounds like a cost-optimization issue but irrelevant for Shield Advanced. |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Step-by-Step Strategy:**

1. **Scope Check**: Shield Advanced = AWS resources only (eliminate "external servers").
2. **Pricing Model**: Fixed $3,000/month (eliminate "Savings Plans").
3. **Multi-Account Context**: Always check for **Consolidated Billing** in cost-related questions.

**Red Flags:**

- "Outside AWS" → Immediately invalid for most AWS-native services.
- "Savings Plans" → Only applies to compute usage (EC2, Lambda, Fargate).

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shield Advanced Cost | $3,000/month per **organization** (with Consolidated Billing) |
| Protection Scope     | Only AWS resources (EC2, ALB, Global Accelerator, etc.)       |
| Savings Plans        | **Not applicable** – fixed monthly fee                        |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Why Consolidated Billing Matters**:

  - Without it, each account pays the full $3,000/month.
  - With it, all accounts in an Organization share **one $3,000 fee**.

- **Common Misconceptions**:

  - Myth: Shield Advanced protects hybrid environments. **Truth**: AWS-only.
  - Myth: Usage affects pricing. **Truth**: Flat fee regardless of traffic volume.

- **Exam Tip**:  
  Shield Advanced questions often test **scope** (AWS-only) and **billing** (Consolidated Billing requirement).

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:** `Configure a scheduled action to scale-out before peak traffic`

| Option                     | Verdict      | Detailed Reasoning                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lifecycle hook**         | ❌ Incorrect | Lifecycle hooks manage **instance state transitions** (e.g., scaling-in delays), not scaling triggers.           |
| **Step scaling policy**    | ❌ Incorrect | Step scaling reacts to **real-time metrics** (e.g., CPU > 70%), but causes lag for **predictable** spikes.       |
| **Target tracking policy** | ❌ Incorrect | Like step scaling, it’s **reactive** – adjusts capacity based on live metrics (e.g., request count).             |
| **Scheduled action**       | ✅ Correct   | **Proactively** scales resources **before** predicted traffic spikes (e.g., "Add 5 instances at 8:30 AM daily"). |

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lifecycle hook       | Sounds related to scaling but is about **instance lifecycle management**.                      |
| Step/target tracking | Both are valid scaling policies but **reactive**, making them poor for **predictable** spikes. |
| Scheduled action     | Obvious if you know the difference between proactive/reactive scaling.                         |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Key Strategy:**

- **Predictable** = Scheduled actions (e.g., "every weekday at 8 AM").
- **Unpredictable** = Dynamic scaling (step/target tracking).

**Red Flags:**

- "Performance lag" + "predictable" → Implies **proactive** scaling is needed.
- "Lifecycle hook" → Almost always a distractor in scaling questions.

| Alternative for hybrid patterns | Scheduled + dynamic scaling combined |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Scheduled Actions**:

  - Set **minimum/desired capacity** at specific times (e.g., `desired=10` at 8 AM).
  - Supports **one-time** or **recurring** schedules (e.g., cron expressions).

- **Combining Strategies**:  
  Use scheduled actions **with** dynamic scaling to handle predictable spikes + unexpected surges.

- **Exam Tip**:  
  If the question mentions "predictable," "daily," or "known," **scheduled scaling** is likely the answer.

   - Encryption = **VPN** (IPsec).
3. **Eliminate Mismatches**:
   - VPN alone = slow.
   - Direct Connect alone = unencrypted.

**Red Flags:**

- "Transit Gateway" → Only for AWS resources.
- "Operational overhead" → Implies complex but justified solutions (e.g., Direct Connect + VPN).

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Why Combine Direct Connect + VPN?**

  - Direct Connect provides **private, high-speed** links but isn’t encrypted.
  - VPN adds **IPsec encryption** without sacrificing performance (since it runs over the private connection).

- **Operational Overhead Explained**:

  - Direct Connect requires **physical cross-connects** at an AWS Direct Connect Location.
  - VPN setup needs **Customer Gateway (CGW)** and **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** configuration.

- **Alternatives**:
  - For **cost-sensitive** use cases: VPN-only (tradeoffs accepted).
  - For **ultra-low latency**: Direct Connect + MACsec (Layer 2 encryption).

| Server Access Logging  | Feels like it might persist due to audit requirements |
| Static Website Hosting | Seems fundamental to bucket configuration             |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Key Strategy:**

1. Look for features that fundamentally change how S3 stores data (versioning affects object storage at a core level)
2. Eliminate logging/billing features first (typically mutable)
3. Remember: Versioning is the only "one-way switch" in core S3 features

**Red Flags:**

- "Only be suspended" → Almost always points to versioning
- Features affecting storage mechanics → Higher chance of being irreversible

| Cost Impact          | Continue paying for stored versions even when suspended |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Versioning Mechanics:**

  - When suspended:
    - Stops creating new versions
    - Maintains all existing versions
    - Can be re-enabled later

- **Why AWS Designed It This Way:**

  - Prevents accidental data loss from versioning disablement
  - Ensures compliance with data retention policies

- **Exam Tip:**  
  If a question mentions "cannot be disabled" or "only suspended" for S3, think **versioning** first.

- **Real-World Impact:**  
  Companies often don't realize they'll keep paying for versions after suspension - a major cost consideration.

| Option 3 (✅ stateless + stateful) | Clear and correct                                           |
| Option 4 (stateful + stateful)     | Moderate – tempting if user thinks REST can retain sessions |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Look for REST = stateless
- Look for WebSocket = stateful and full-duplex

**Tip:**  
If **persistence or real-time communication** is required, always associate it with **WebSockets**. RESTful APIs reset state on each request.

| REST APIs are **stateless**     | Each request is independent and doesn’t retain context |
| WebSocket APIs are **stateful** | Maintains a persistent connection across sessions      |
| API Gateway supports both types | Allows architecting hybrid communication layers        |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- RESTful APIs follow HTTP and are **stateless by design**, which helps with scalability and caching.
- WebSocket APIs **maintain open TCP connections**—allowing the server to push data to clients anytime.
- **API Gateway** supports both models, letting teams build **stateless CRUD endpoints** and **stateful real-time features** in parallel.

### Question 'SAA-Q110'

A telecom company operates thousands of hardware devices like switches, routers, cables, etc. The real-time status data for these devices must be fed into a communications application for notifications. Simultaneously, another analytics application needs to read the same real-time status data and analyze all the connecting lines that may go down because of any device failures. As a Solutions Architect, which of the following solutions would you suggest, so that both the applications can consume the real-time status data concurrently?

- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
- Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)
- Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

---

## 1. In Simple English

You need to send **real-time device status data** to **two separate applications**:

- One for **sending notifications**,
- One for **analyzing connection failure risks**.

Both need to process the **same data stream concurrently**, and it must be **real-time**.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**  
Look for keywords like:

- **Real-time data**
- **Multiple consumers**
- **Streaming analytics**

These should point you to **Kinesis** or **MSK** (if Kafka is involved).

**Tip:**  
SQS is for **single consumer queueing**, SNS is for **pub/sub**, and Kinesis is for **streaming with parallel readers**.

### Question 'SAA-Q111'

A healthcare startup needs to enforce compliance and regulatory guidelines for objects stored in Amazon S3. One of the key requirements is to provide adequate protection against accidental deletion of objects. As a solutions architect, what are your recommendations to address these guidelines? (Select two)

- Enable versioning on the bucket
- Change the configuration on AWS S3 console so that the user needs to provide additional confirmation while deleting any S3 object
- Create an event trigger on deleting any S3 object. The event invokes an SNS notification via email to the IT manager
- Establish a process to get managerial approval for deleting S3 objects
- Enable MFA delete on the bucket

---

## 1. In Simple English

The healthcare company wants to prevent **accidental deletion** of files in S3. You need to suggest **two AWS-native features** that help with this, to meet compliance requirements.

| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable versioning on the bucket**                 | ✅ Correct   | Keeps all versions of an object, so if deleted, older versions can be restored—ideal for accidental deletion.               |
| **Change configuration for confirmation on delete** | ❌ Incorrect | AWS console does not provide configurable confirmation dialogs—this is not a feature.                                       |
| **Event trigger for deletion → SNS**                | ❌ Incorrect | This **informs** someone **after** deletion; it doesn’t prevent the deletion itself.                                        |
| **Managerial approval process**                     | ❌ Incorrect | A manual procedure, not an AWS-native feature. Doesn’t enforce technical protection.                                        |
| **Enable MFA delete**                               | ✅ Correct   | Requires MFA for versioned object deletions. Adds a **strong layer of protection** against accidental or malicious deletes. |

### Question 'SAA-Q112'

A US-based healthcare startup is building an interactive diagnostic tool for COVID-19 related assessments. The users would be required to capture their personal health records via this tool. As this is sensitive health information, the backup of the user data must be kept encrypted in S3. The startup does not want to provide its own encryption keys but still wants to maintain an audit trail of when an encryption key was used and by whom. Which of the following is the BEST solution for this use-case?

- Use SSE-C to encrypt the user data on S3
- Use SSE-S3 to encrypt the user data on S3
- Use SSE-KMS to encrypt the user data on S3
- Use client-side encryption with client provided keys and then upload the encrypted user data to S3

---

## 1. In Simple English

The startup needs to encrypt user health data stored in S3.

- They **don’t want to manage their own encryption keys**
- But they **do want to track key usage (audit trail)**

### Question 'SAA-Q113'

A media agency stores its re-creatable assets on Amazon S3 buckets. The assets are accessed by a large number of users for the first few days and the frequency of access falls down drastically after a week. Although the assets would be accessed occasionally after the first week, but they must continue to be immediately accessible when required. The cost of maintaining all the assets on S3 storage is turning out to be very expensive and the agency is looking at reducing costs as much as possible. As a Solutions Architect, can you suggest a way to lower the storage costs while fulfilling the business requirements?

- Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 7 days
- Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days
- Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 30 days
- Configure a lifecycle policy to transition the objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 7 days

| **HTTP 503: Service unavailable**   | ✅ Correct   | This is returned when **no healthy or registered targets** are available to handle the request.                               |
| **HTTP 502: Bad gateway**           | ❌ Incorrect | Happens when a gateway (like a load balancer) receives an **invalid response** from the backend — which is not the case here. |
| **HTTP 504: Gateway timeout**       | ❌ Incorrect | Indicates the backend took **too long to respond**, not applicable when no backend is configured.                             |

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP 500** | Common fallback guess for “server error” but doesn’t apply to ALBs — refers to application-level problems.                               |
| **HTTP 502** | Looks reasonable since a load balancer is a gateway, but only applies when **something malformed** is returned from a registered target. |
| **HTTP 504** | Misleading if you assume “timeout” means the backend is offline — but it specifically means “slow response”, not “no response”.          |
| **HTTP 503** | ✅ The only correct one — may be overlooked if you’re not familiar with how ALBs behave with zero or unhealthy targets.                  |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Always recall that **Application Load Balancers actively check the health** of registered targets.
- If **no targets are healthy or present**, then **HTTP 503 is the correct response**.
- Know your **HTTP status codes by number and meaning** — this is a memorization-heavy area in the exam.

**Tip:**  
Think like a system admin: if **nothing is listening on the backend**, then ALB **can’t route**, so it logically returns “Service Unavailable”.

| 503  | Service Unavailable   | No registered or healthy targets                | ✅ Best match for this case           |
| 504  | Gateway Timeout       | Target is too slow or unreachable after timeout | ✅ But only when a slow target exists |

---

## 10. Summary Table

| Requirement                 | Best Fit |
| --------------------------- | -------- |
| ALB has **no targets**      | HTTP 503 |
| ALB gets **weird response** | HTTP 502 |
| ALB waits too long          | HTTP 504 |
| App crashes or internal bug | HTTP 500 |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **HTTP 503** is the **canonical error** when **no targets are available or healthy** in an Application Load Balancer's target group. It signals that the load balancer is up, but cannot forward the request to any functional backend.
- This can also occur **if health checks fail across all instances**, not just when zero targets are registered. So, knowing how health checks work is critical.
- Unlike 500 (which is **app logic** failure) or 502 (which involves **bad data returned** from a backend), 503 is about **unavailability**, which matches the ALB scenario with no targets.
- **Why is 503 preferred by AWS?** Because it explicitly tells the client, “I’m functioning, but no one is behind me to serve this request.”
- From a DevOps/SRE standpoint, encountering a 503 from your ALB should trigger a health check review or backend registration audit — it’s often a deployment misstep.

### Question 'SAA-Q121'

A geological research agency maintains the seismological data for the last 100 years. The data has a velocity of 1GB per minute. You would like to store the data with only the most relevant attributes to build a predictive model for earthquakes. What AWS services would you use to build the most cost-effective solution with the LEAST amount of infrastructure maintenance?

- Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Analytics and use SQL queries to filter and transform the data before writing to S3
- Ingest the data in AWS Glue job and use Spark transformations before writing to S3
- Ingest the data in a Spark Streaming Cluster on EMR use Spark Streaming transformations before writing to S3
- Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Firehose and use a Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming stream before the output is dumped on S3

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Kinesis Data Analytics**    | Moderate – sounds serverless, but optimized for SQL-based stream **analysis**, not ETL to S3     |
| **Glue Job (Spark)**          | High – Glue is often assumed to be streaming, but it's designed for **batch ETL** workflows      |
| **EMR Spark Streaming**       | Medium – powerful and scalable, but **infrastructure-heavy** for the low-maintenance requirement |
| **Kinesis Firehose + Lambda** | ✅ Clear winner, though less flashy — you must know Firehose can do **transforms via Lambda**    |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Look for clues like: **"cost-effective"**, **"real-time"**, and especially **"least maintenance"**
- Eliminate any answer involving **EMR or Glue** when low operational overhead is required.
- Default to **Firehose + Lambda** for serverless stream transformation that ends up in **S3**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Kinesis Firehose** is the go-to AWS service for **zero-maintenance stream ingestion** into S3, Redshift, or OpenSearch.
- Firehose automatically scales with input traffic and supports **buffering, compression, and encryption** without any manual setup.
- **Lambda transformation** in Firehose allows real-time filtering — ideal when you only need to retain **important attributes**.
- Unlike Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose **doesn’t require consumer applications or custom polling** — it's push-based and fully managed.
- Using **EMR or Glue** for this use case would drastically increase your **operational overhead**, including managing clusters, setting up job dependencies, and handling retries or failure logic manually.
- **Kinesis Data Analytics** is more suited for dashboards, aggregations, or custom alerts — not ideal for simply filtering and storing high-speed telemetry.
- For long-term scientific or research applications like seismology, the **Firehose → Lambda → S3** pipeline offers **a scalable, low-touch solution** that aligns well with future machine learning modeling or querying via Amazon Athena.

### Question 'SAA-Q122'

An audit department generates and accesses the audit reports only twice in a financial year. The department uses AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the report creating process that has failover and retry scenarios built into the solution. The underlying data to create these audit reports is stored on S3, runs into hundreds of Terabytes and should be available with millisecond latency. As a solutions architect, which is the MOST cost-effective storage class that you would recommend to be used for this use-case?

- Amazon S3 Standard
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
- Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier)
- Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)

---

## 1. In Simple English

The audit team stores a lot of data (hundreds of TBs) but only accesses it **twice per year**. It must remain available **instantly** (low latency). What's the **cheapest** S3 storage class that meets those needs?

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Standard**            | Mild – sounds safe, but is overpriced for rare access                                                    |
| **S3 Glacier**             | High – very tempting for "infrequent" needs, but fails due to **non-millisecond** access                 |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** | Medium – sounds flexible, but incurs monthly overhead fees even when access is predictable               |
| **S3 Standard-IA**         | ✅ Clear winner — cost-effective, instantly accessible, and perfect for predictable low-access workloads |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Start by mapping the access **frequency** to the proper S3 class:
  - **>1/month** = S3 Standard
  - **<1/month, with instant access** = S3 Standard-IA
  - **Archival needs** with flexible retrieval = Glacier or Deep Archive
- Cross-check against **latency requirements** — Glacier classes are **not suitable** for real-time data access.

**Tip:**  
If the data is rarely accessed _but still needs to be available immediately_, **S3 Standard-IA** is the sweet spot.

## 10. Summary Table

| Business Requirement             | Matching Storage Class |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Large data (hundreds of TBs)     | ✅ All supported       |
| Rare access (2x/year)            | ✅ S3 Standard-IA      |
| Instant millisecond latency      | ❌ Glacier classes     |
| Cost-effective & low maintenance | ✅ S3 Standard-IA      |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **S3 Standard-IA** is designed exactly for scenarios like audit logs, compliance data, and backups that are rarely accessed but must be **available immediately**.
- It costs **~60% less than S3 Standard** for storage and includes a **per-GB retrieval fee**, which is acceptable when access is infrequent.
- Choosing **S3 Glacier** would fail the **millisecond latency** requirement — Glacier offers 3 retrieval tiers: Expedited (1–5 min), Standard (minutes), and Bulk (hours), all of which are too slow.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**, while flexible, includes **monthly monitoring and automation charges**. It is suited for workloads where access patterns change or are unpredictable.
- The **Step Functions** orchestration in this scenario does not impact the storage class choice directly, but it reinforces the need for reliable, responsive data access at scheduled intervals.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Use **elimination by performance limits**:
  - gp2 = baseline
  - gp3 = up to 16K IOPS
  - io1/io2 = up to 64K IOPS
  - io2 Block Express = up to **256K IOPS**
- Know **what supports Multi-Attach**: **only io1/io2**, not gp2/gp3
- Look for **Nitro mention** to confirm support for advanced EBS features

**Tip:**  
If a question includes **"Multi-Attach"** or **"256,000 IOPS"**, the answer almost always involves **io2 Block Express** on **Nitro-based EC2**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS)** volumes are intended for **I/O-intensive workloads**, like databases or high-frequency transaction systems.
- **io2 Block Express** is the **next-gen high-performance EBS** that requires **Nitro EC2 instances** and supports:
  - Up to **256,000 IOPS**
  - **4,000 MB/s throughput**
  - **Sub-millisecond latency**
- **Multi-Attach** allows a single EBS volume to be mounted to **multiple EC2 instances** simultaneously — useful for clustering or HA scenarios like Oracle RAC or SAP HANA.
- Only **io1 and io2** support Multi-Attach, and **only within the same AZ**.
- **gp2 and gp3** are great for cost-effective general-purpose workloads but do **not support Multi-Attach**.
- Choosing the wrong volume type can significantly limit **scalability, throughput**, or even violate **HA designs**.

### Question 'SAA-Q125'

The payroll department at a company initiates several computationally intensive workloads on EC2 instances at a designated hour on the last day of every month. The payroll department has noticed a trend of severe performance lag during this hour. The engineering team has figured out a solution by using Auto Scaling Group for these EC2 instances and making sure that 10 EC2 instances are available during this peak usage hour. For normal operations only 2 EC2 instances are enough to cater to the workload. As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend to implement the solution?

- Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a target tracking policy and setting the instance count to 10 at the designated hour. This causes the scale-out to happen before peak traffic kicks in at the designated hour

- Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off at the designated hour on the last day of the month. Set the min count as well as the max count of instances to 10. This causes the scale-out to happen before peak traffic kicks in at the designated hour

- Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off at the designated hour on the last day of the month. Set the desired capacity of instances to 10. This causes the scale-out to happen before peak traffic kicks in at the designated hour

- Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a simple tracking policy and setting the instance count to 10 at the designated hour. This causes the scale-out to happen before peak traffic kicks in at the designated hour

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:**  
**Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off at the designated hour on the last day of the month. Set the desired capacity of instances to 10. This causes the scale-out to happen before peak traffic kicks in at the designated hour.**

| -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Target tracking policy**             | ❌ Incorrect         | Used for reactive scaling based on metrics (CPU, etc.), not ideal for fixed time events. |
| **Scheduled action with min/max = 10** | ❌ Overkill          | It locks the instance count at 10 even when not needed, increasing costs.                |
| **Scheduled action with desired = 10** | ✅ Correct           | Best option. Scales to 10 instances before the event, then scales down afterward.        |
| **Simple tracking policy**             | ❌ Invalid construct | “Simple tracking policy” is not a valid ASG feature term.                                |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- If the load is **predictable and time-based**, use **scheduled scaling**.
- If the load is **unpredictable and based on metrics**, use **target tracking** or **step scaling**.
- Use **`desired capacity`** in scheduled actions to temporarily scale out without permanently locking high `min` values.

**Tip:**  
Avoid changing `min` and `max` unless necessary. Scheduled scaling using `desired` capacity gives more **flexibility and cost control**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** can scale capacity in three ways: dynamic scaling (metric-based), scheduled scaling (time-based), and manual.
- **Scheduled actions** are best for **predictable events** such as:
  - End-of-month billing
  - Daily report generation
  - Weekly batch processes
- **Desired capacity** is the ideal setting for scheduled actions — it temporarily overrides the `min` and `max`, allowing flexibility.
- Setting `min` and `max` to high values locks the instance count and can cause **unnecessary over-provisioning and cost**.
- AWS **recommends combining scheduled actions** with **metric-based scaling policies** for hybrid optimization.
- The "simple tracking policy" term is a red herring — **always verify actual AWS terminology** when unsure.

### Question 'SAA-Q126'

The engineering team at an in-home fitness company is evaluating multiple in-memory data stores with the ability to power its on-demand, live leaderboard. The company's leaderboard requires high availability, low latency, and real-time processing to deliver customizable user data for the community of users working out together virtually from the comfort of their home. As a solutions architect, which of the following solutions would you recommend? (Select two)

- Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using RDS Aurora as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

- Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using AWS Neptune as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

- Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

- Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using DynamoDB as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

- Power the on-demand, live leaderboard using ElastiCache Redis as it meets the in-memory, high availability, low latency requirements

---

## 1. In Simple English

You need to choose two AWS services that provide **very fast access** to data, can support **real-time leaderboard updates**, and are **highly available**. The key is to find **in-memory** or near-memory-speed databases that can **scale** and offer **low latency** for heavy concurrent read/write workloads.

| **RDS Aurora**        | ❌ Incorrect                          | Aurora is optimized for transactional consistency but is not in-memory or real-time optimized for leaderboards. It adds I/O overhead and latency. |
| **AWS Neptune**       | ❌ Incorrect                          | Neptune is purpose-built for graph queries, not ideal for fast-moving leaderboard-style writes and reads.                                         |
| **DynamoDB + DAX**    | ✅ Correct                            | DAX is a memory-caching layer for DynamoDB, ideal for high-frequency, low-latency leaderboard lookups.                                            |
| **DynamoDB (alone)**  | ❌ Technically valid but not best fit | While DynamoDB is low-latency, DAX makes it more suitable for **very** fast in-memory leaderboard access.                                         |
| **ElastiCache Redis** | ✅ Correct                            | Redis is a popular choice for leaderboards — it's ultra-fast, supports sorted sets, and works great with real-time updates.                       |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Immediately identify **keywords** like "in-memory", "real-time", and "low latency"
- Eliminate general-purpose databases unless enhanced with cache or acceleration
- Match service to access pattern: real-time reads = Redis or DAX; analytics = S3, Athena; graphs = Neptune

**Tip:**  
For anything that updates rapidly and needs millisecond-to-microsecond reads (like **game scores**, **IoT metrics**, or **live dashboards**), think:

- **ElastiCache Redis** (sorted sets for leaderboards)
- **DynamoDB + DAX** (fully managed, scalable, cache-optimized NoSQL)

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **ElastiCache Redis** supports **sorted sets**, a data structure ideal for building leaderboards where players are ranked by score.
- Redis is **truly in-memory**, meaning all operations happen in RAM, which enables **sub-millisecond latency**.
- **DynamoDB with DAX** offers an **AWS-native in-memory cache** in front of DynamoDB tables, allowing microsecond read performance without modifying the data layer.
- **DynamoDB alone** can deliver low latency (under 10ms) but lacks the ultra-low latency performance of in-memory caches.
- **Aurora and Neptune**, while high-performing and highly available, are not in-memory systems and not designed for high-speed concurrent access required for leaderboards.
- Using **Redis and DAX together**, many AWS customers build **hybrid data access layers** — Redis for ultra-frequent lookups (like leaderboard rank), DynamoDB for persistence and broader data access.
- For **real-time virtual interactions** such as users exercising simultaneously, the need for fast reads and updates is non-negotiable. That’s why **Redis and DAX** are AWS’s go-to answers in such scenarios.

### Question 'SAA-Q127'

A new DevOps engineer has just joined a development team and wants to understand the replication capabilities for RDS Multi-AZ as well as RDS Read-replicas. Which of the following correctly summarizes these capabilities for the given database?

- Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

- Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

- Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. Read replicas follow synchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

- Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans one Availability Zone within a single region. Read replicas follow synchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're being asked to compare **Multi-AZ deployments** with **Read Replicas** for Amazon RDS in terms of:

- Replication **type** (synchronous vs. asynchronous)
- Replication **scope** (within AZ, cross-AZ, cross-region)

**Strategy:**

- Break the question into two parts: Multi-AZ vs Read Replica.
- Associate **Multi-AZ with HA** and **sync replication**, **Read Replicas with scaling** and **async replication**.
- Watch for reversed logic — that’s often the trick in these questions.

| Correct Answer | Multi-AZ is **synchronous**, Read Replica is **asynchronous**, and spans multiple AZs or regions |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Multi-AZ**: When you deploy an RDS instance in Multi-AZ mode, AWS automatically provisions and maintains a standby replica in a different **Availability Zone**. Replication is **synchronous**, ensuring zero data loss during failover. This is a high availability (HA) feature, not a scaling solution.
- **Read Replicas**: Designed for **read scalability**, not HA. They use **asynchronous replication**, meaning there is a small delay (replication lag) between updates to the primary and the replica. Useful for reporting, analytics, and cross-region disaster recovery.
- **Cross-Region Capabilities**: Only read replicas support cross-region deployments. Multi-AZ stays strictly within a region.
- **Common Misconception**: Many engineers mistakenly think Multi-AZ replicas can be used for reads or span regions. Both are false.
- **Choosing Wisely**: Use **Multi-AZ** when uptime and automatic failover are critical. Use **read replicas** when scaling reads or replicating across regions for latency reduction or DR purposes.

### Question 'SAA-Q128'

CloudFront offers a multi-tier cache in the form of regional edge caches that improve latency. However, there are certain content types that bypass the regional edge cache and go directly to the origin. Which of the following content types skip the regional edge cache? (Select two)

- E-commerce assets such as product photos
- Dynamic content, as determined at request time (cache-behavior configured to forward all headers)
- Proxy methods PUT/POST/PATCH/OPTIONS/DELETE go directly to the origin
- User-generated videos
- Static content such as style sheets, JavaScript files

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **CloudFront Caching Layers**:
  - **Edge Locations**: Closest to the user.
  - **Regional Edge Caches**: Buffer between edge and origin — reduce origin fetches.
- **Bypassing Conditions**:
  - If a cache behavior is configured to forward **all headers**, **cookies**, or **query strings**, CloudFront considers the request **unique and dynamic**, and bypasses both the edge and regional cache layers.
  - Methods like **PUT**, **POST**, **PATCH**, **DELETE**, and **OPTIONS** are **never cached** by CloudFront. These HTTP verbs are always routed to the origin server.
- **Misconception**: Just because content is user-generated (like videos), doesn't mean it's not cacheable. If the content is served as a static object (e.g., MP4), it will still be cached.
- **Key Strength**: Understanding these behaviors allows architects to optimize both **latency** and **origin cost**.
- **Real-World Use**: For websites with login-specific dashboards or real-time data (like weather or e-commerce inventory), careful cache configuration is crucial. But failing to configure it properly may bypass CloudFront’s optimization layers entirely — leading to poor performance.

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answers:**

- **Attach an IAM policy to your file system to control clients who can mount your file system with the required permissions**
- **Use VPC security groups to control the network traffic to and from your file system**
- **Use EFS Access Points to manage application access**

| **Use VPC security groups**                  | ✅ Correct   | Security groups control NFS port (2049) access, allowing only specific EC2s to mount                |
| **Set up IAM root credentials**              | ❌ Incorrect | Root credentials should never be used for regular operations, and don’t control EFS access directly |
| **Use EFS Access Points**                    | ✅ Correct   | Access points let you define user IDs and permissions per application                               |
| **Use Amazon GuardDuty**                     | ❌ Incorrect | GuardDuty is a threat detection service and does **not control access** to EFS                      |
| **Use Network ACLs on EC2**                  | ❌ Incorrect | ACLs are coarse-grained; **security groups** are preferred and more effective in this scenario      |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Consider **multiple layers of access control**: network (SGs), identity (IAM), and filesystem (EFS POSIX).
- Watch out for options that **sound security-related** but don’t actually enforce access (e.g., GuardDuty).
- Prioritize **least privilege** — don’t recommend root credentials or shared accounts.

**Tip:**

> If it's access control, think _who can reach it_, _who can mount it_, and _what they can do once mounted._

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **IAM with EFS**: While IAM typically controls API access, Amazon EFS also uses IAM for **client-level authorization** when EC2 instances attempt to mount using the `efs-utils` package. IAM roles can explicitly allow or deny NFS mount permissions, adding a crucial identity-based layer of access control.

- **Security Groups vs. NACLs**:

  - **Security Groups** are stateful and apply directly to instances and mount targets, making them the first line of defense.
  - **Network ACLs** are stateless and apply at the subnet level, better suited for broader traffic filtering, not fine-grained EC2-EFS control.

- **EFS Access Points**:

  - These abstract POSIX user identity (UID/GID) management, allowing you to enforce directory paths, permission boundaries, and isolate applications without needing to manually configure all EC2s to use the same Linux-level file permissions.
  - Think of them as "application-specific entry points" to the file system.

- **GuardDuty Misconception**:

  - GuardDuty is powerful for **detecting suspicious activity**, but **does not block or allow** access.
  - It is **not part of an access control solution** but complements it by monitoring and reporting.

- **Root IAM Credentials**:

  - These should be locked away. Best practice is to never use the root user except for specific administrative tasks (like closing the account).
  - Using them for day-to-day access control violates least privilege.

- **Security Layering Principle**:
  - Always apply **Defense in Depth**: combine IAM, SGs, and filesystem-level controls to secure EFS.
  - No single control is sufficient on its own for sensitive workloads.

### Question 'SAA-Q130'

A file-hosting service uses Amazon S3 under the hood to power its storage offerings. Currently all the customer files are uploaded directly under a single S3 bucket. The engineering team has started seeing scalability issues where customer file uploads have started failing during the peak access hours with more than 5000 requests per second. Which of the following is the MOST resource efficient and cost-optimal way of addressing this issue?

- Change the application architecture to use EFS instead of Amazon S3 for storing the customers' uploaded files
- Change the application architecture to create customer-specific custom prefixes within the single bucket and then upload the daily files into those prefixed locations
- Change the application architecture to create a new S3 bucket for each customer and then upload each customer's files directly under the respective buckets
- Change the application architecture to create a new S3 bucket for each day's data and then upload the daily files directly under that day's bucket

---

## 1. In Simple English

Your application is using a **single S3 bucket**, and during **peak hours**, too many upload requests (over 5000/sec) are causing throttling or failures. How can you fix this **without spending too much or overcomplicating the solution**?

| **Use EFS instead of S3**                             | ❌ Incorrect | EFS is not designed for web-scale object storage; it’s not suitable for this use case and incurs higher cost and complexity        |
| **Use customer-specific prefixes in a single bucket** | ✅ Correct   | S3 performance scales **per prefix** — distributing keys into multiple prefixes improves parallelism and avoids request throttling |
| **One bucket per customer**                           | ❌ Incorrect | Creating thousands of buckets is overkill, hard to manage, and unnecessary — S3 already scales per prefix                          |
| **One bucket per day**                                | ❌ Incorrect | This helps with temporal separation but doesn't solve prefix-level scaling or customer-specific request spikes                     |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Understand how AWS services scale under high load.
- Know that **S3 scales per prefix**, and if you're getting throttled, you likely have a prefix bottleneck.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **S3 Request Scaling**: Amazon S3 **automatically scales to high request rates** for each **prefix** in a bucket. To avoid throttling, you **distribute your keys across many prefixes**. For example:

  - `/customer-001/2025-06/file.jpg`
  - `/customer-002/2025-06/file.jpg`

- **Prefix Parallelization**: By designing key names with varying prefixes, such as customer IDs or hash segments, you **parallelize** S3's underlying storage partitions, enabling it to handle tens of thousands of requests per second without errors.

- **Why NOT more buckets**: AWS recommends using a small number of buckets with organized naming schemes instead of a bucket explosion. Too many buckets complicate permissions, logging, and lifecycle rules.

- **Cost impact**: All S3 requests are billed, but bucket creation and management don’t carry extra charges—yet complexity leads to **indirect costs** like maintenance and policy management.

- **When to consider Intelligent-Tiering or Glacier**: If this were a **storage class** or **cost** optimization question (not performance), lifecycle policies and tiered storage might come up—but this question is about throughput.

- **Other Pitfalls**: Changing to EFS would remove the durability and global availability S3 offers, with **no benefit** for object-scale throughput in this use case.

### Question 'SAA-Q131'

A software engineering intern at an e-commerce company is documenting the process flow to provision EC2 instances via the Amazon EC2 API. These instances are to be used for an internal application that processes HR payroll data. He wants to highlight those volume types that **cannot** be used as a boot volume. Can you help the intern by identifying those storage volume types that CANNOT be used as boot volumes while creating the instances?  
**(Select two)**

- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
- Instance Store
- Cold HDD (sc1)
- General Purpose SSD (gp2)
- Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)

**Strategy:**

- Eliminate volume types commonly used with Amazon Machine Images (AMIs): `gp2`, `io1`.
- Consider intended use cases:

  - Instance store = ephemeral and conditional boot support (legacy only)

**Tip:**

> If the storage type is designed for **cold or sequential** access — it's probably not usable for booting an OS.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Cold HDD (sc1)** and **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)** are **not supported** for use as root (boot) volumes. They are designed for data archival and throughput-heavy data processing, respectively — not for booting operating systems.

- **Instance Store** can technically be used as a boot volume, but only under very **specific and outdated** configurations using **instance-store-backed AMIs**. AWS now strongly recommends using **EBS-backed instances** for reliability and flexibility.

- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)** and **General Purpose SSD (gp2)** are **fully supported** for root volumes. In fact, most modern AMIs default to `gp2` for root.

- AWS recommends designing infrastructure to rely on **bootable EBS volumes** (`gp2`, `gp3`, `io1`, `io2`) due to better durability, snapshot support, and ease of automation.

### Question 'SAA-Q132'

A company uses Amazon S3 buckets for storing sensitive customer data. The company has defined different retention periods for different objects present in the Amazon S3 buckets, based on the compliance requirements. But, the retention rules do not seem to work as expected. Which of the following options represent a **valid configuration** for setting up retention periods for objects in Amazon S3 buckets?  
**(Select two)**

- When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version
- You cannot place a retention period on an object version through a bucket default setting
- The bucket default settings will override any explicit retention mode or period you request on an object version
- When you use bucket default settings, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version
- Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're asked to select the two statements that correctly describe **how Amazon S3 retention rules work**, especially in the context of **Object Lock**, **versioning**, and **retention periods**.

---

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answers:**

- **When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version**
- **Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods**

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apply retention explicitly → specify Retain Until Date** | ✅ Correct   | When applying a retention **directly** to an object version, you define an explicit “Retain Until Date” |
| **You cannot place retention via bucket default**          | ❌ Incorrect | You **can** set default retention for the bucket which applies to new object versions unless overridden |
| **Bucket default overrides explicit retention**            | ❌ Incorrect | **Explicit retention always takes precedence** over the bucket default                                  |
| **Bucket default = specify Retain Until Date**             | ❌ Incorrect | Bucket default sets a **retention period duration**, not a specific date                                |
| **Versions have different retention modes**                | ✅ Correct   | S3 Object Lock works **per version**, so different versions can have **unique retention settings**      |

| **Cannot set retention through default**      | ✅ Misleading         | Defaults are allowed and common — just not final if overridden |
| **Different retention per version**           | ✅ Seems odd but true | Each version is independently managed                          |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Understand that **S3 Object Lock operates per object version**.
- Know the distinction between:
  - **Explicit retention** = precise “retain until” date
  - **Bucket default** = general policy unless overridden
- Always ask: “Is this retention tied to **the version**, and is it an override or a default?”

**Tip:**

> "Explicit object-level settings beat defaults. Versions are treated independently."

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Retention policies in Amazon S3** are part of **Object Lock**, which enables write-once-read-many (WORM) protection.
- There are two modes:
  - **Governance mode**: Users with special permission can override
  - **Compliance mode**: Cannot be removed or shortened by any user
- When an object is uploaded into a bucket with default retention, that setting applies **unless** an explicit retention period is defined during the PUT/POST request.
- **Retain Until Date** is a timestamp (RFC 3339 format) indicating how long a specific object version is protected.
- The ability for **each version to have different retention settings** allows for **fine-grained compliance** and **data lifecycle management**.

### Question 'SAA-Q133'

A leading video streaming service delivers billions of hours of content from Amazon S3 to customers around the world. Amazon S3 also serves as the data lake for its big data analytics solution. The data lake has a **staging zone where intermediary query results are kept only for 24 hours**. These results are also **heavily referenced** by other parts of the analytics pipeline. Which of the following is the **MOST cost-effective strategy** for storing this intermediary query data?

- Store the intermediary query results in S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class
- Store the intermediary query results in S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class
- Store the intermediary query results in S3 Standard storage class
- Store the intermediary query results in S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class

  - **Storage duration**: less than 30 days = no IA classes!
- Eliminate any class with **minimum duration charges** if data is short-lived

**Tip:**

> If the data is accessed a lot **and** lives for **less than 30 days**, only **S3 Standard** fits perfectly.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **S3 Standard** is best for:

  - Temporary staging zones
  - Frequently accessed content
  - No minimum duration or tier monitoring costs

- **S3 Standard-IA and One-Zone-IA** may appear cheaper, but:

  - They impose **30-day minimum** charges per object
  - Are optimized for **long-lived**, **rarely accessed** data — not for hourly/daily processing

- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** is only cost-effective for **longer-lived objects** (typically >30 days), where access patterns change over time — not for predictable, short-term pipelines

- **Real-World Impact**: Choosing the wrong storage class for intermediate analytics (e.g., IA for short-lived data) often leads to **unexpected costs** despite low per-GB pricing.

### Question 'SAA-Q134'

A solo founder at a tech startup has just created a brand new AWS account. The founder has provisioned an EC2 instance 1A which is running in **region A**. Later, he takes a **snapshot** of instance 1A and then creates a new **AMI** in region A from this snapshot. This AMI is then **copied into another region B**. The founder provisions an instance 1B in region B using this **new AMI in region B**.

At this point in time, **what entities exist in region B**?

- 1 EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot exist in region B
- 1 EC2 instance and 1 AMI exist in region B
- 1 EC2 instance and 2 AMIs exist in region B
- 1 EC2 instance and 1 snapshot exist in region B

---

## 1. In Simple English

The founder creates:

1. An instance in **region A**
2. A snapshot from it
3. An AMI from the snapshot in **region A**
4. Copies the AMI to **region B**
5. Launches a new EC2 instance in **region B** using that copied AMI.

Now: What resources **exist in region B**?

## 2. Verbiage & Realism

| Aspect               | Evaluation                                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario Realism** | Common startup scenario — cross-region deployment for DR or latency        |
| **Language Clarity** | Very clear — tracks resource propagation from one region to another        |
| **Deceptiveness**    | Subtle — snapshot vs AMI tracking and copy mechanics can confuse beginners |

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cross-region AMI behavior** | What happens when you copy an AMI between AWS regions?                         |
| **Implicit snapshot copying** | Copying an AMI between regions **creates a new snapshot** in the target region |
| **EC2 regional isolation**    | All AWS resources (instances, AMIs, snapshots) are region-scoped               |

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:**  
**1 EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot exist in region B**

| Option                               | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot** | ✅ Correct   | Copying an AMI to another region **also copies the underlying snapshot**                            |
| **1 instance and 1 AMI**             | ❌ Incorrect | The AMI would not work without a snapshot — a snapshot is **automatically created** during AMI copy |
| **1 instance and 2 AMIs**            | ❌ Incorrect | Only **1 AMI** exists in Region B (the copied one)                                                  |
| **1 instance and 1 snapshot**        | ❌ Incorrect | The copied AMI still exists as a named resource in region B — not just the snapshot                 |

| **2 AMIs**            | ✅ Yes                                       | Suggests double-copying, but only **one AMI copy** is made                                        |
| **Snapshot-only**     | ✅ Yes                                       | Misleads by implying the AMI is lost or doesn’t exist independently                               |
| **Correct option**    | ❌ Clear if familiar with AMI copy mechanics |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Remember that **all EC2 resources are regional**: snapshots, AMIs, instances.
- When **copying an AMI** across regions:
  - AWS **automatically creates** a new **snapshot** in the destination region.
  - The new AMI **references that new snapshot** — they are linked.
- No resources are implicitly copied unless specifically triggered (e.g., snapshot isn’t copied unless part of AMI copy).

| AMI from region A | ❌ No               | AMIs are region-specific   |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **EC2 AMIs are region-scoped**, meaning they must be copied explicitly to be usable in another region.
- When copying an AMI:
  - A **new AMI ID** is created in the destination region.
  - The **backing snapshot(s)** for the AMI are also **copied** and become region-local resources.
- After the copy:
  - You get **1 EC2 instance**, **1 AMI**, and **1 snapshot** in Region B.
  - The original snapshot and AMI still exist in Region A unless explicitly deleted.
- **Why it matters**:
  - In regulated workloads or DR scenarios, this ensures that backups and launch templates are available across regions with minimal configuration.

### Question 'SAA-Q135'

The DevOps team at an e-commerce company wants to perform some maintenance work on a specific EC2 instance that is part of an Auto Scaling group using a step scaling policy. The team is facing a maintenance challenge - every time the team deploys a maintenance patch, the instance health check status shows as out of service for a few minutes. This causes the Auto Scaling group to provision another replacement instance immediately. As a solutions architect, which are the MOST time/resource efficient steps that you would recommend so that the maintenance work can be completed at the earliest? (Select two)

- Suspend the ReplaceUnhealthy process type for the Auto Scaling group and apply the maintenance patch to the instance. Once the instance is ready, you can manually set the instance's health status back to healthy and activate the ReplaceUnhealthy process type again

- Take a snapshot of the instance, create a new AMI and then launch a new instance using this AMI. Apply the maintenance patch to this new instance and then add it back to the Auto Scaling Group by using the manual scaling policy. Terminate the earlier instance that had the maintenance issue

- Suspend the ScheduledActions process type for the Auto Scaling group and apply the maintenance patch to the instance. Once the instance is ready, you can manually set the instance's health status back to healthy and activate the ScheduledActions process type again

- Put the instance into the Standby state and then update the instance by applying the maintenance patch. Once the instance is ready, you can exit the Standby state and then return the instance to service

- Delete the Auto Scaling group and apply the maintenance fix to the given instance. Create a new Auto Scaling group and add all the instances again using the manual scaling policy

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company needs to patch an EC2 instance that is part of an Auto Scaling Group. However, every time the patch is applied, the health check fails briefly, which causes Auto Scaling to prematurely replace the instance. How can they patch it **without causing replacement**?

| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suspend the ReplaceUnhealthy process type...            | ✅ Correct     | Prevents Auto Scaling from terminating the instance when its health check fails during patching.    |
| Take a snapshot, create new AMI, launch new instance... | ❌ Inefficient | Creates unnecessary work. Not the most time/resource-efficient method.                              |
| Suspend the ScheduledActions process type...            | ❌ Incorrect   | ScheduledActions controls scheduled scaling, not instance health. Irrelevant here.                  |
| Put the instance into the Standby state...              | ✅ Correct     | Temporarily removes instance from ASG and load balancer without terminating it. Ideal for patching. |
| Delete the Auto Scaling group and recreate...           | ❌ Overkill    | Extremely inefficient and risky. Not recommended.                                                   |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- Look for **temporary disconnection mechanisms** like "Standby" that let you pause activity without termination.
- Understand how **Auto Scaling processes** like `ReplaceUnhealthy` can be suspended to avoid unintended replacements.
- Eliminate drastic or inefficient options like deleting ASGs unless explicitly asked.

| Avoid overkill         | Don’t delete ASG or create unnecessary AMIs          |
| Efficient maintenance  | Keep existing instance alive and reintegrate quickly |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **ReplaceUnhealthy** is one of many Auto Scaling processes. Suspending it pauses health-check-driven terminations.
- **Standby state** removes an instance from active traffic and Auto Scaling health checks, making it ideal for patching or debugging.
- **Health checks** (ELB or EC2 status) failing during maintenance are expected; suspending relevant Auto Scaling responses is the right mitigation.
- **Avoid instance churn** by keeping the same instance patched and reused — it saves launch time, avoids IP reassignment issues, and reduces startup overhead.
- Always reinstate Auto Scaling configurations (processes or lifecycle states) post-maintenance to avoid degraded resilience.

- Always start by asking: “Does this **downgrade availability** or **reverse** tiering?”
- AWS lifecycle transitions are **one-way** and do not allow upgrading redundancy.
- If Intelligent-Tiering is the **destination**, that's often valid; if it's the source, it's often **not**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Lifecycle transitions must reduce cost**, not increase durability or performance.
- **Intelligent-Tiering** is not a source for transitions. You can’t move **from** it to any other class.
- **IA to IA transitions (e.g., One Zone-IA to Standard-IA)** are disallowed via lifecycle because they **upgrade durability**, which is **not supported automatically**.
- Use lifecycle policies only for **downward or lateral cost-optimizing transitions** — upgrades must be handled manually.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Cluster placement groups** are ideal for tightly coupled applications like MPI workloads, simulations, genomics, and seismic processing.
- Instances in a cluster placement group are placed within the same rack or adjacent racks in a single Availability Zone to **maximize network performance**.
- **EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)** can be paired with Cluster Placement Groups for **sub-millisecond latency and low jitter**, further boosting HPC workloads.
- **Partition placement groups** shine in Hadoop, Spark, and Cassandra — not HPC.
- **Spread placement groups** are about **resilience**, not performance.
- **Auto Scaling** is great for stateless or spiky apps, but irrelevant for parallel, inter-dependent compute nodes like those used in planetary simulations.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- Look for keywords like “content-based routing” → **Application Load Balancer**
- Look for “high availability” or “fault tolerance” → **Auto Scaling**
- Disregard IP-centric answers when the question is about **routing logic** or application-layer traffic.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is designed for:

  - Routing requests based on **host/path**
  - Handling **HTTPS termination**
  - Integrating seamlessly with **Auto Scaling Groups**

- **Auto Scaling Groups** maintain desired instance count and recover failed EC2 instances automatically.

- **Elastic IPs** and **Public IPs** are static addresses — they do not perform any traffic distribution or routing logic.

- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is useful for TCP-based applications (e.g., low-latency gaming, VoIP), but it **does not** support URL-based or header-based routing.

### Question 'SAA-Q140'

The sourcing team at the US headquarters of a global e-commerce company is preparing a spreadsheet of the new product catalog. The spreadsheet is saved on an EFS file system created in `us-east-1` region. The sourcing team counterparts from other AWS regions such as Asia Pacific and Europe also want to collaborate on this spreadsheet. As a solutions architect, what is your recommendation to enable this collaboration with the **LEAST** amount of operational overhead?

**Single answer**

- The spreadsheet data will have to be moved into an RDS MySQL database which can then be accessed from any AWS region
- The spreadsheet on the EFS file system can be accessed in other AWS regions by using an inter-region VPC peering connection
- The spreadsheet will have to be copied into EFS file systems of other AWS regions as EFS is a regional service and it does not allow access from other AWS regions
- ✅ **The spreadsheet will have to be copied in Amazon S3 which can then be accessed from any AWS region**

---

## 1. In Simple English

The spreadsheet lives in EFS (which is regional), but the team is global. You need a way for other AWS regions to access it easily. The question is asking **what's the least effort** way to do that.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon EFS** is a regional service. Although **inter-region VPC peering** is technically supported (since Oct 2018), it involves:
  - Manual DNS resolution of mount targets
  - Cross-VPC security group configuration
  - Potential latency and performance issues
- **Amazon S3** allows object access from any region without needing custom routing or peering setups. It's the **most accessible and operationally simple** option for global collaboration.
- The correct answer on the AWS exam must balance **technical feasibility** with **operational simplicity**, and **S3** provides both.

### Question 'SAA-Q141'

A leading social media analytics company is contemplating moving its dockerized application stack into AWS Cloud. The company is not sure about the pricing for using Elastic Container Service (ECS) with the EC2 launch type compared to the Elastic Container Service (ECS) with the Fargate launch type. Which of the following is correct regarding the pricing for these two services?

**Single answer**

- Both ECS with EC2 launch type and ECS with Fargate launch type are charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used
- Both ECS with EC2 launch type and ECS with Fargate launch type are just charged based on Elastic Container Service used per hour
- Both ECS with EC2 launch type and ECS with Fargate launch type are charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests
- ✅ **ECS with EC2 launch type is charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used. ECS with Fargate launch type is charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests**

---

## 1. In Simple English

This question is testing your understanding of **how ECS billing differs** between **EC2 launch type** (you manage the instances) and **Fargate launch type** (AWS manages the compute). You need to pick the answer that explains the correct pricing model for each.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

✅ **Strategy:** Start by asking **who manages the infrastructure** — if it’s **you** (EC2 launch), you’re billed for EC2. If **AWS** manages it (Fargate), you’re billed per task’s **CPU and memory**.  
🧠 **Tip:** Always recall that **ECS itself is free** — you only pay for the resources you run it on.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon ECS** supports two main launch types:
  - **EC2 launch type**: You provision and manage EC2 instances and attach EBS if needed.
  - **Fargate launch type**: You don’t provision any infrastructure. You pay **only for what your containerized app needs** — in terms of vCPU and memory — for the task duration.
- ECS **itself** has **no cost** — pricing is tied to the compute backend used.
- If your organization wants **more control**, EC2 may be suitable.
- If you prioritize **cost efficiency, scalability, and reduced management**, **Fargate** is the better choice — and is commonly used in modern microservices architectures.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- The **root user** in AWS has **unrestricted access** — it should only be used for **initial setup and emergency tasks**.
- **MFA** helps prevent unauthorized access even if the password is compromised.
- AWS **strongly advises disabling or avoiding root access keys**. If they are created, they should be deleted immediately after use.
- Use **IAM roles and users** for all routine administrative and programmatic access.
- **Credential managers** like AWS Secrets Manager or secure enterprise password vaults are better than ad-hoc encrypted S3 buckets for storing secrets.

### Question 'SAA-Q143'

An organization wants to delegate access to a set of users from the development environment so that they can access some resources in the production environment which is managed under another AWS account. As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend?

- Create new IAM user credentials for the production environment and share these credentials with the set of users from the development environment
- ✅ **Create a new IAM role with the required permissions to access the resources in the production environment. The users can then assume this IAM role while accessing the resources from the production environment**
- It is not possible to access cross-account resources
- Both IAM roles and IAM users can be used interchangeably for cross-account access

---

## 1. In Simple English

The question is asking how to **safely share access between two AWS accounts** — development and production — without compromising security. The **best and AWS-recommended solution** is to create an IAM role in the production account that **users from the dev account can assume**.

- **IAM roles are meant to be assumed temporarily**, making them ideal for scenarios where **cross-account or temporary access** is required.
- A trust policy defines **which principals (users, roles, accounts)** can assume a role.
- The user assuming the role must have an **IAM policy** granting them permission to use `sts:AssumeRole`.
- This setup allows for **centralized identity management** (e.g., dev users remain in the dev account) and avoids **credential sprawl** or **hardcoded access keys**.
- **CloudTrail** can be used to audit role assumptions and actions taken in the production account using that role.

### Question 'SAA-Q144'

A research group needs a fleet of EC2 instances for a specialized task that must deliver high random I/O performance. Each instance in the fleet would have access to a dataset that is replicated across the instances. Because of the resilient application architecture, the specialized task would continue to be processed even if any instance goes down, as the underlying application architecture would ensure the replacement instance has access to the required dataset. Which of the following options is the MOST cost-optimal and resource-efficient solution to build this fleet of EC2 instances?

- ✅ **Use Instance Store based EC2 instances**
- Use EBS based EC2 instances
- Use EC2 instances with access to S3 based storage
- Use EC2 instances with EFS mount points

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

✅ Focus on the **I/O pattern** (random vs sequential), **data durability needs**, and whether **replication exists**.  
🧠 If the app handles its own replication and durability is not required, **ephemeral storage like instance store** becomes optimal for speed and cost.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Instance store volumes are physically attached to the host server**, offering **lower latency and higher throughput** than network-based storage.
- These volumes are **ephemeral**, meaning they are deleted when the instance stops or terminates — but this is acceptable for stateless, replicated data.
- For **batch processing**, **scientific computing**, or **cache-heavy** workloads, instance store is highly recommended when you don’t need persistence.
- Developers must **manually copy** data to instance store at launch time if needed — but in this scenario, the **dataset is replicated**, so that's accounted for.
- Alternatives like **EBS or EFS** would incur unnecessary cost and introduce network latency.

### Question 'SAA-Q145'

A major bank is using SQS to migrate several core banking applications to the cloud to ensure high availability and cost efficiency while simplifying administrative complexity and overhead. The development team at the bank expects a peak rate of about 1000 messages per second to be processed via SQS. It is important that the messages are **processed in order**. Which of the following options can be used to implement this system?

- Use Amazon SQS FIFO queue in batch mode of 2 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate
- Use Amazon SQS FIFO queue to process the messages
- Use Amazon SQS standard queue to process the messages
- Use Amazon SQS FIFO queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate

---

## 1. In Simple English

The bank needs to:

- Handle **high throughput** (about **1000 messages/second**)
- **Maintain strict order** of message delivery
- Use **Amazon SQS**, a managed message queuing service

Which queue type and configuration guarantees **message ordering** while also meeting throughput demands?

| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SQS FIFO queue in batch mode (2 messages)** | ✅ Valid but suboptimal | Ensures order, but batching 2 messages might not fully utilize the 3000 msg/s limit FIFO can support via larger batches and multiple message groups.                                                                                                                                       |
| **SQS FIFO queue (no batching)**              | ❌ Inefficient          | Ensures order but limits throughput to 300 msg/s per message group. Without batching, the queue might become a bottleneck at high volumes.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **SQS Standard queue**                        | ❌ Incorrect            | Supports high throughput, but **does not guarantee message order**, which is a hard requirement in this case.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **SQS FIFO queue in batch mode (4 messages)** | ✅ **Best choice**      | Maintains order **and** increases throughput. By batching up to 10 messages per operation and using multiple message groups, FIFO queues can scale up to 3000 msg/s. A batch size of 4 is reasonable and helps hit the required throughput of 1000 msg/s while preserving strict ordering. |

---

## 5. Final Answer

> **Use Amazon SQS FIFO queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate**

This provides **ordered delivery** and sufficient **throughput scalability** for the application's performance needs.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **FIFO Queues:**

  - Guarantee **exactly-once processing** with deduplication
  - Respect **message group IDs** to maintain strict ordering
  - Can process **up to 3000 messages/second** with batching and multiple message groups

- **Batching Benefits:**

  - Reduces API overhead (fewer `SendMessage` and `ReceiveMessage` calls)
  - Increases throughput while maintaining order **within** a message group

- **Why Standard Queues Don't Work Here:**

  - **At-least-once delivery** introduces **duplication and out-of-order** delivery risks
  - Even if faster, they're inappropriate for **banking or financial workflows** where message sequence is critical

- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - FIFO = Standing in line at a bank: each person gets served in the order they arrived
  - Standard = Chat room messages: they might arrive slightly out of order, but everyone eventually gets the info

By using **FIFO + batching**, the bank meets both its **ordering and performance** needs with a cost-effective and scalable architecture.

### Question 'SAA-Q146'

The DevOps team at a data analytics company has observed that its flagship application functions at its peak performance when the underlying EC2 instances have a CPU utilization of about 50%. The application is built on a fleet of EC2 instances managed under an Auto Scaling group. The workflow requests are handled by an internal Application Load Balancer that routes the requests to the instances. As a solutions architect, what would you recommend so that the application runs near its peak performance state?

- Configure the Auto Scaling group to use simple scaling policy and set the CPU utilization as the target metric with a target value of 50%
- Configure the Auto Scaling group to use target tracking policy and set the CPU utilization as the target metric with a target value of 50%
- Configure the Auto Scaling group to use a CloudWatch alarm triggered on a CPU utilization threshold of 50%
- Configure the Auto Scaling group to use step scaling policy and set the CPU utilization as the target metric with a target value of 50%

---

## 1. In Simple English

The application runs best when EC2 instances are using around **50% CPU**. The architecture uses:

- An **Auto Scaling group** to manage EC2 capacity
- An **Application Load Balancer** to route traffic

You need a solution that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances so CPU stays close to **50%**, ensuring optimal performance.

| ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple scaling policy with CPU = 50%**  | ❌ Incorrect   | Simple scaling requires explicit actions tied to CloudWatch alarms. It reacts to thresholds but doesn’t continuously aim for a specific target. Not ideal for maintaining a “sweet spot” CPU level. |
| **Target tracking policy with CPU = 50%** | ✅ **Correct** | Target tracking automatically adjusts the instance count to keep **CPU utilization near 50%**, similar to a thermostat. It’s ideal for keeping performance stable with minimal configuration.       |
| **CloudWatch alarm at CPU 50%**           | ❌ Incorrect   | Alarms alone don’t scale anything. They can trigger notifications or actions, but they don’t inherently manage Auto Scaling behavior.                                                               |
| **Step scaling with CPU = 50%**           | ❌ Incorrect   | Step scaling defines thresholds with graduated responses (e.g., scale up by 2 when CPU > 70%). It’s less fluid and requires more tuning than target tracking.                                       |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Target Tracking Policies** function like thermostats:

  - You specify the desired metric value (e.g., 50% CPU), and AWS Auto Scaling **adds or removes instances** to maintain that state.

- **Auto Scaling + ALB**:

  - ALBs work seamlessly with Auto Scaling groups, automatically rerouting traffic to healthy new instances as the group scales.

- **Why Not Use Step Scaling?**

  - Step scaling works better for **predictable traffic spikes** with defined thresholds (e.g., a spike every day at 9 AM).
  - For applications with **continuous or unpredictable** traffic (like analytics workloads), target tracking offers a **more adaptive** and **responsive** approach.

- **Best Practice Tip**:
  - Always monitor with **CloudWatch dashboards** even when using target tracking, so you can visualize scaling events and tweak target values if necessary.

By recommending **target tracking**, you ensure your application remains in its high-efficiency zone, scaling just enough to avoid both under-provisioning and excessive costs.

### Question 'SAA-Q147'

A gaming company is looking at improving the availability and performance of its global flagship application which utilizes **UDP protocol** and needs to support **fast regional failover** in case an AWS Region goes down. The company wants to continue using its own **custom DNS** service. Which of the following AWS services represents the best solution for this use-case?

- **Amazon CloudFront**
- **AWS Global Accelerator**
- **AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**
- **Amazon Route 53**

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to:

- Run a **global application** with low latency
- Use **UDP traffic** (common in real-time gaming)
- **Quickly failover** to a healthy region if one becomes unavailable
- Continue using **their own DNS service**, not AWS-hosted domains

We need to pick the AWS service that best enables global performance and regional failover—**without relying on Route 53 for DNS** and that **supports UDP traffic**.

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity**            | The question gives clear performance, availability, protocol (UDP), and DNS constraints                  |
| **Realistic Scenario** | Very realistic – games often use UDP for real-time interaction and require high uptime                   |
| **Tricky Phrasing**    | The emphasis on **custom DNS** subtly disqualifies Route 53; mention of **UDP** filters out some options |

| -------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon CloudFront**      | ❌ Incorrect   | CloudFront is a global content delivery network for **HTTP/HTTPS traffic** (TCP-based). It **doesn’t support UDP**, and can’t route arbitrary app traffic or provide failover across regions.                                                   |
| **AWS Global Accelerator** | ✅ **Correct** | Supports **both TCP and UDP**, accelerates global traffic, and provides **automatic regional failover** using any endpoint (ALB, NLB, EC2, etc.). It lets clients connect via **static IPs**, so you can use **custom DNS** to resolve to them. |
| **Elastic Load Balancing** | ❌ Incorrect   | ELB (specifically NLB) supports UDP but operates within **a single region**. It does **not provide global traffic routing or regional failover**.                                                                                               |
| **Amazon Route 53**        | ❌ Incorrect   | While Route 53 supports failover routing, **it’s a DNS service**. Since the company uses a **custom DNS**, this option is incompatible with their requirements.                                                                                 |

## 5. Final Answer

> **AWS Global Accelerator**

It provides **UDP support**, **regional health checks and failover**, and allows you to use **your own DNS** by pointing to **static anycast IPs** it provisions.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

1. Identify **protocol requirements** (e.g., UDP = no CloudFront or ALB)
2. Check for **DNS constraints** (custom DNS disqualifies Route 53)
3. Look for keywords like “**global failover**” and match to services that support **multi-region**

### Tip:

> If the question mentions **custom DNS + global failover + UDP**, your best answer is almost always **Global Accelerator**.

### Question 'SAA-Q148'

A telecom company operates thousands of hardware devices like switches, routers, cables, etc. The real-time status data for these devices must be fed into a **communications application** for notifications. Simultaneously, another **analytics application** needs to read the same **real-time status data** and analyze all the connecting lines that may go down because of any device failures.

As a Solutions Architect, which of the following solutions would you suggest, so that **both applications can consume the real-time status data concurrently**?

- Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
- Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)
- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
- Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company has two apps that need to read **the same real-time data**:

- One sends **notifications**
- The other runs **analytics**

You need a solution where **both apps can read the same stream of data at the same time** without interfering with each other.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**:

  - Supports **multiple consumer applications**, each tracking its own position in the stream
  - Stores records for **24 hours (default)** or up to **7 days**
  - Allows replaying data in case of failure or lagging downstream systems
  - Integrates with **AWS Lambda**, **Kinesis Data Analytics**, **Firehose**, and **custom consumers**

- **Why Not SNS/SQS?**

  - **SNS** is best for fan-out, but it’s not persistent and lacks replay
  - **SQS** delivers a message to **only one** consumer; duplicating queues is manual and inefficient
  - **Kinesis** ensures that multiple consumers can **read the same data stream concurrently** without duplication or race conditions

- **Real-World Analogy:**
  - **SQS/SNS** = sending individual texts to recipients
  - **Kinesis** = broadcasting a live video stream that multiple people can watch (and rewin

### Question 'SAA-Q149'

A healthcare startup needs to enforce compliance and regulatory guidelines for objects stored in Amazon S3. One of the key requirements is to provide **adequate protection against accidental deletion of objects**. As a solutions architect, what are your recommendations to address these guidelines?  
**(Select two)**

- Change the configuration on AWS S3 console so that the user needs to provide additional confirmation while deleting any S3 object
- Establish a process to get managerial approval for deleting S3 objects
- Enable MFA delete on the bucket
- Enable versioning on the bucket
- Create an event trigger on deleting any S3 object. The event invokes an SNS notification via email to the IT manager

---

## 1. In Simple English

The healthcare company wants to:

- **Prevent accidental deletion** of critical data in S3
- Stay **compliant with data protection regulations**

We need two **AWS-native features** that **technically enforce** safeguards to prevent or recover from accidental deletions.

| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Change S3 console to require deletion confirmation** | ❌ Incorrect | There is **no built-in S3 console feature** that enforces an extra confirmation step for deletions. Console prompts are UI-based and easily bypassed; they don't constitute compliance-level protection.                             |
| **Establish managerial approval process**              | ❌ Incorrect | This is an **administrative control**, not a technical enforcement. It’s important for governance but not a solution that satisfies technical compliance audits.                                                                     |
| **Enable MFA delete**                                  | ✅ Correct   | **MFA Delete** adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a valid **multi-factor authentication code** to permanently delete **object versions**. Prevents unauthorized or accidental deletions, especially by root/admin users. |
| **Enable versioning**                                  | ✅ Correct   | **Versioning** maintains **previous versions** of objects. If a delete request is made, only the latest version is marked as deleted (with a delete marker), making **object recovery easy**.                                        |
| **Create an SNS notification on delete**               | ❌ Incorrect | This is **reactive** – it informs someone **after deletion** happens. It does **not prevent** deletion or protect the data. Useful for audit trails but insufficient as a protective mechanism.                                      |

## 5. Final Answer

> ✅ **Enable MFA delete on the bucket**  
> ✅ **Enable versioning on the bucket**

This combination provides **technical enforcement** against accidental deletion and enables recovery when deletion occurs.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

1. Distinguish between **reactive** (alerting, auditing) vs **proactive** (blocking, preserving) measures
2. Choose options that are **enforced via AWS config or policy**, not human processes
3. Focus on **compliance**, which demands **technical enforcement** not suggestions or manual steps

### Tip:

> **MFA Delete = block permanent deletions**  
> **Versioning = undo deletions**

Use both together for ironclad object protection.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Versioning Basics:**

  - Keeps a full **history of object changes and deletions**
  - Deleting a versioned object just adds a **delete marker**; prior versions can be restored
  - Works seamlessly with lifecycle policies for archival

- **MFA Delete Requirements:**

  - Can only be enabled via **CLI or API**
  - Requires **MFA device** (e.g., virtual or hardware token)
  - Prevents **permanent deletion** unless MFA is presented

- **Compliance Advantage:**

  - These features help meet data durability and recoverability requirements from frameworks like **HIPAA**, **SOC 2**, and **GDPR**

- **Complementary Tools:**
  - Combine **S3 Object Lock** (WORM) and **Bucket Policies** for even stricter controls
  - Use **AWS Config Rules** to monitor compliance with versioning/MFA settings

By recommending **Versioning + MFA Delete**, you provide both **data recoverability** and **deletion protection**—an ideal compliance-aligned solution for sensitive workloads like those in healthcare.

### Question 'SAA-Q150'

A geological research agency maintains the seismological data for the last 100 years. The data has a velocity of **1 GB per minute**. You would like to store the data with only the **most relevant attributes** to build a **predictive model** for earthquakes.

What AWS services would you use to build the **most cost-effective solution** with the **LEAST amount of infrastructure maintenance**?

- Ingest the data in a Spark Streaming Cluster on EMR and use Spark Streaming transformations before writing to S3
- Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Analytics and use SQL queries to filter and transform the data before writing to S3
- Ingest the data in AWS Glue job and use Spark transformations before writing to S3
- Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Firehose and use a Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming stream before the output is dumped on S3

---

## 1. In Simple English

You have **high-velocity data (1 GB/min)** coming in continuously from seismic sensors.

Your goal:

- **Filter and transform** this data in real-time
- Store only **relevant** attributes
- Build a **cost-effective**, **low-maintenance** pipeline

You need AWS services that can do this **serverlessly**, without provisioning clusters or managing compute infrastructure.

| **Spark Streaming Cluster on EMR**                | ❌ Incorrect            | While powerful, **EMR requires provisioning and maintaining a cluster**, including scaling, tuning, and lifecycle policies. It's costly and not aligned with the "least maintenance" requirement.                      |
| **Kinesis Data Analytics with SQL queries**       | ❌ Valid but suboptimal | Fully managed and serverless, but it requires **SQL proficiency**, and the **transformation logic is more limited** than what you can do in code via Lambda. The author cites **flexibility concerns** as a trade-off. |
| **AWS Glue + Spark transformations**              | ❌ Incorrect            | AWS Glue is designed for **batch ETL**, not streaming data. It cannot handle **continuous ingestion at 1 GB/min**, and it introduces significant delay and infrastructure overhead.                                    |
| **Kinesis Data Firehose + Lambda transform → S3** | ✅ **Correct**          | **Fully serverless, real-time, and scalable.** Firehose handles stream buffering and delivery to S3, while Lambda gives you full control over filtering/transformation logic. Minimal setup and maintenance required.  |

## 5. Final Answer

> **Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Firehose and use a Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming stream before the output is dumped on S3**

It provides **real-time filtering**, **zero infrastructure management**, and enough transformation flexibility to meet complex use cases—ideal for building cost-efficient predictive pipelines.

  - Supports **Python, Node.js, Java, Go** — allowing complex filtering, enrichment, or cleanup
  - Scales with incoming throughput
  - Maximum concurrency and memory usage must be considered for **large-scale workloads**

- **Alternative Considerations**:
  - Kinesis Data Analytics is ideal when the transformation logic is **simple and SQL-based**
  - Use **Firehose + Lambda** when you need **fine-grained filtering**, **external enrichment**, or **non-SQL logic**

By choosing **Kinesis Firehose + Lambda**, the agency gets a **real-time, highly scalable, and low-maintenance** pipeline—ideal for selective data retention, cost savings, and feeding downstream machine learning models.

### Question 'SAA-Q151'

A leading carmaker would like to build a new **car-as-a-sensor service** by leveraging **fully serverless components** that are provisioned and managed automatically by AWS. The development team does **not** want any option that requires **manual capacity provisioning**, because it doesn’t want to react manually to changing sensor-data volumes.

Which of the following solutions is the **BEST** fit?

- **Option A:** Ingest the sensor data in an Amazon SQS standard queue, polled by an application running on an EC2 instance, and write to an auto-scaled DynamoDB table
- **Option B:** Ingest the sensor data in a Kinesis Data Stream, polled by an application running on an EC2 instance, and write to an auto-scaled DynamoDB table
- **Option C:** Ingest the sensor data in an Amazon SQS standard queue, polled by a Lambda function in batches, and write to an auto-scaled DynamoDB table
- **Option D:** Ingest the sensor data in a Kinesis Data Stream, polled by a Lambda function in batches, and write to an auto-scaled DynamoDB table

---

## 1. In Simple English

- **Need:** Collect live data from thousands of vehicles and store it.
- **Must be:** Entirely **serverless**—no servers, clusters, or shard math to worry about.
- **Want:** Automatic scale-up / scale-down as traffic spikes or dips.

| **A – SQS → EC2 → DynamoDB**        | ❌ Incorrect   | EC2 means you must size, patch, and scale instances—violates “fully serverless.”                                                                                                       |
| **B – Kinesis → EC2 → DynamoDB**    | ❌ Incorrect   | Double penalty: shard provisioning _and_ EC2 management.                                                                                                                               |
| **C – SQS → Lambda → DynamoDB**     | ✅ Best        | **All components are serverless, auto-scaling, and fully managed.** Lambda automatically adjusts concurrency based on queue depth; SQS scales virtually infinitely without shard math. |
| **D – Kinesis → Lambda → DynamoDB** | ❌ Sub-optimal | Lambda is serverless, but **you still provision/scale shards in Kinesis**, which constitutes manual capacity management.                                                               |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **SQS Standard** queues support virtually **unlimited TPS** and require **no pre-capacity planning**.
- **AWS Lambda** integrates natively with SQS, **long-polls** the queue, and dynamically increases the number of function instances to keep up with message volume.
- **Kinesis Data Streams** is excellent for ordered, high-frequency telemetry but **demands shard provisioning**; resizing shards on the fly is possible but still a manual step (or requires extra automation).
- **Connected-vehicle pipelines** often pair SQS/Lambda for telemetry ingestion when simplicity and ops-free scaling trump strict ordering.

This design therefore meets the carmaker’s mandate for a **fully managed, auto-scaling, and low-operational-burden** architecture.

A new DevOps engineer has just joined a development team and wants to understand the replication capabilities for **RDS Multi-AZ** as well as **RDS Read Replicas**.

Which of the following correctly summarizes these capabilities for the given database?

- **Option A:** Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. Read replicas follow synchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region
- **Option B:** Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region
- **Option C:** Multi-AZ follows asynchronous replication and spans one Availability Zone within a single region. Read replicas follow synchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region
- **Option D:** Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Multi-AZ** is primarily for **HA and failover**, not performance scaling.

  - It uses **synchronous replication** to keep a standby up-to-date.
  - If the primary fails, **RDS automatically fails over** to the standby in a different AZ.

- **Read Replicas** are designed for **performance** and **offloading read traffic**.
  - They use **asynchronous replication**, so they may be **slightly behind the primary**.
  - You can have **multiple read replicas**, and even **cross-region replicas** to support latency-sensitive users globally.
  - Failover to a read replica is **not automatic** — you'd have to promote it manually.

This question checks whether you understand both **replication behavior** and **infrastructure design** differences between two cornerstone RDS features — crucial for designing resilient, scalable AWS database systems.

### Question 'SAA-Q153'

A company uses **Amazon S3 buckets** to store **sensitive customer data**. The company has defined **different retention periods** for different objects based on compliance policies. However, the retention rules **aren’t working as expected**.

Which of the following options represent a **valid configuration** for setting retention periods on Amazon S3 objects?  
**(Select TWO)**

- The bucket default settings will override any explicit retention mode or period you request on an object version
- When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a **Retain Until Date** for the object version
- When you use bucket default settings, you specify a **Retain Until Date** for the object version
- Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods
- You cannot place a retention period on an object version through a bucket default setting

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to enforce **different retention rules** per object based on compliance.

You're asked:

- Which statements about **S3 object retention and Object Lock** are **correct**?
- You need to choose two that reflect **valid AWS behavior**.

| **The bucket default settings will override any explicit retention mode or period you request on an object version**          | ❌ Incorrect | **Explicit settings override bucket defaults**, not the other way around. Bucket defaults apply _only_ when no explicit retention is set.          |
| **When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version** | ✅ Correct   | You can directly apply a **Retain Until Date** and specify **compliance or governance mode** on an individual object version.                      |
| **When you use bucket default settings, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version**                              | ❌ Incorrect | Bucket defaults don’t use a fixed date like “Retain Until.” They use a **retention duration (in days or years)** applied upon object creation.     |
| **Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods**                                      | ✅ Correct   | Retention settings are **version-specific**, so it’s valid and common to have **different rules per version**.                                     |
| **You cannot place a retention period on an object version through a bucket default setting**                                 | ❌ Incorrect | You **can** apply retention automatically using bucket defaults, but they are applied **at the time of object creation**, unless overridden later. |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Know the **difference between bucket-level default rules and per-object retention**
- Remember that **versioning + Object Lock** allows **granular control** per object version

### Tip:

> **Defaults apply at write time**. Explicit retention **always wins** if both are defined.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **S3 Object Lock Modes**:

  - **Governance mode**: Prevents overwrite/deletion by most users (except with special permission)
  - **Compliance mode**: Enforces write-once-read-many (WORM); no deletion allowed even by admins

- **Retain Until Date** is **only** assignable when **explicitly applying a retention period** to an object version—not via bucket default settings

- **Why retention rules may "not work"**:
  - Object Lock was not enabled at bucket creation
  - Default settings didn’t apply to overwritten objects
  - Retention wasn't explicitly set on updated versions
  - IAM permissions allowed bypassing governance-mode locks

By understanding how **retention settings interact between bucket defaults and object versions**, engineers can better enforce compliance-grade data protection policies.

### Question 'SAA-Q154'

A leading video streaming service delivers billions of hours of content from Amazon S3 to customers around the world. Amazon S3 also serves as the data lake for its big data analytics solution. The data lake has a **staging zone** where **intermediary query results** are kept for **only 24 hours**. These results are **heavily referenced** by other parts of the analytics pipeline.

Which of the following is the **MOST cost-effective strategy** for storing this intermediary query data?

- Store the intermediary query results in **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access** storage class
- Store the intermediary query results in **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access** storage class
- Store the intermediary query results in **S3 Standard** storage class
- Store the intermediary query results in **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** storage class

### Strategy:

- **Step 1:** Ask: **Will the object last less than 30 days?** → Eliminate IA and Intelligent-Tiering
- **Step 2:** Ask: **Is the object accessed frequently?** → Eliminate IA options
- **Step 3:** Use **S3 Standard** when in doubt for **short-lived, frequently accessed data**

### Tip:

> When data lives for **less than 30 days** and is **frequently used**, always default to **S3 Standard**, even if it seems more expensive at first glance—it avoids **hidden penalties**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **S3 Standard** is ideal for:

  - **Transient data** used in analytics pipelines
  - Data accessed often in **short bursts**
  - Scenarios where you **don’t want surprises** in cost due to retention thresholds

- **Storage class selection** should always consider:

  - **Storage duration**
  - **Access frequency**
  - **Access patterns (e.g., lifecycle transitions)**

- Intelligent-Tiering is still useful for **longer-lived** dynamic data, but not suited for **ephemeral, 1-day jobs** unless the object size is <128 KB (which exempts it from 30-day minimums).

This is a classic example of **choosing cost-efficiency by understanding hidden charges** rather than surface-level per-GB pricing.

### Question 'SAA-Q155'

A solo founder at a tech startup has just created a brand new AWS account. The founder has provisioned an EC2 instance **1A**, which is running in **region A**. Later, he takes a **snapshot** of instance 1A and then creates a **new AMI** in region A from this snapshot.

This AMI is then **copied into another region B**. The founder provisions an instance **1B** in region B using this copied AMI.

At this point in time, **what entities exist in region B**?

- 1 EC2 instance and 2 AMIs exist in region B
- 1 EC2 instance, 1 AMI and 1 snapshot exist in region B
- 1 EC2 instance and 1 snapshot exist in region B
- 1 EC2 instance and 1 AMI exist in region B

---

## 1. In Simple English

The founder:

1. Launches EC2 instance in **region A**
2. Takes a **snapshot** and builds an **AMI** in region A
3. **Copies** that AMI to **region B**
4. Launches another EC2 instance using the **copied AMI in region B**

What resources will be present in **region B only** after this process?

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Understand that **snapshots are region-specific**
- When an **AMI is copied**, AWS **automatically copies the snapshot** into the target region
- After launching an EC2 from a copied AMI, the result is:
  - One **AMI** (copied),
  - One **snapshot** (supporting AMI),
  - One **EC2 instance**

### Tip:

> When AMIs are copied to another region, AWS **automatically replicates the underlying snapshot(s)** into that region — you do **not** need to do it manually.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)** are **regional**, meaning they must be copied between regions before use
- **When copying an AMI**, AWS automatically:
  - **Copies the underlying snapshot(s)** that back the image
  - **Creates a new AMI ID** in the destination region
- **You do not need to copy snapshots separately**
- After provisioning from a copied AMI:
  - You’ll have an EC2 instance (running disk created from snapshot)
  - A new AMI (the image template)
  - A new snapshot (copied version of the original root volume snapshot)

This aligns directly with how AWS manages regionalized resources like AMIs and snapshots and is a common foundational concept in cross-region deployment and disaster recovery designs.

### Question 'SAA-Q156'

The engineering team at an e-commerce company is working on **cost optimizations** for EC2 instances. They want to **manage workloads using a mix of On-Demand and Spot Instances** across **multiple instance types**.

They would like to **create an Auto Scaling group** using this mix.

Which of the following options would allow the engineering team to provision the instances for this use case?

- You can use a **launch configuration or a launch template** to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances
- You can **neither use a launch configuration nor a launch template** to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances
- You can **only use a launch template** to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances
- You can **only use a launch configuration** to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to **combine different EC2 instance types** and **use both Spot and On-Demand instances** in an **Auto Scaling Group** to save costs and improve flexibility.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **AWS RAM (Resource Access Manager)** allows **VPC subnet sharing** between AWS accounts in the **same organization or invited accounts**
- When using **shared subnets**, EC2 instances from different accounts are **provisioned into the same VPC**, so:
  - They **share security groups, NACLs, route tables**
  - No need for peering, TGW, or NAT
- This enables **centralized networking** and **low-cost inter-account EC2 traffic**

This is the **most scalable and cost-efficient** way to connect EC2s across accounts without additional routing infrastructure.

### Question 'SAA-Q158'

A **startup** has developed a **video backup service** hosted on a **fleet of EC2 instances** behind an **Application Load Balancer**. Each instance uses its own **EBS volume** for storing user-uploaded videos.

Users report that they **only see some of their uploaded videos**, depending on **which EC2 instance** they're routed to.

Which of the following is the **MOST optimal solution** to ensure users can view **all their uploaded videos**? (Select **two**)

- Write a one-time job to copy the videos from all EBS volumes to S3 and then modify the application to use **Amazon S3 Standard** for storing the videos
- Mount **EFS** on all EC2 instances. Write a one-time job to copy the videos from all EBS volumes to EFS. Modify the application to use **EFS** for storing the videos
- Write a one-time job to copy the videos from all EBS volumes to **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** and then modify the application to use **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** for storing the videos
- Write a one-time job to copy the videos from all EBS volumes to **DynamoDB** and then modify the application to use **DynamoDB** for storing the videos
- Write a one-time job to copy the videos from all EBS volumes to **RDS** and then modify the application to use **RDS** for storing the videos

---

## 1. In Simple English

Users can’t see all their videos because each EC2 instance stores files **locally** on its own EBS volume — so video access depends on **which server they hit**.

The solution? Move video storage to a **centralized** or **shared** system like S3 or EFS so **every server can access the same data**, regardless of routing.

| RDS                  | High       | RDS isn't built for blob-style storage and would scale poorly           |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- If users access large media files: ✅ Think **S3 or EFS**
- If you need fast access from multiple EC2s: ✅ Think **EFS**
- If the question mentions long-term archival only: ✅ Then consider **S3 Glacier**
- Avoid using **databases** for storing large binary files

### Tip:

> S3 = Object storage for static files  
> EFS = Shared file storage  
> EBS = Local instance storage  
> Don’t use RDS or DynamoDB to store media files

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- The **root cause** of the user complaints is that **EBS is local to a single EC2 instance**, and the system is behind a **load balancer** — this makes the service **stateful**, which is not ideal in a scalable cloud architecture.
- Solutions like **Amazon S3** and **Amazon EFS** are designed for **centralized access**:
  - **S3**: Great for storing immutable video files with near-infinite scale and low cost
  - **EFS**: Ideal when the application requires a file system interface and shared access across multiple instances
- Choosing **the right storage architecture** is crucial in designing **stateless, scalable** applications that can function reliably behind load balancers

### Question 'SAA-Q159'

An application processes **big data workloads** on **EC2 instances**. It requires:

- A **minimum of 20 instances** for acceptable performance
- Up to **300 instances** during peak loads
- Historical data shows that **80 instances are required 80% of the time**

As a Solutions Architect, which of the following would you recommend as the **MOST cost-optimal** solution to meet the **steady-state** workload demand?

- Purchase **80 Spot Instances**. Use Auto Scaling Group to provision the remaining instances as On-Demand instances per the workload demand
- Purchase **80 On-Demand Instances**. Use Auto Scaling Group to provision the remaining instances as Spot Instances per the workload demand
- Purchase **80 Reserved Instances**. Provision additional On-Demand and Spot Instances per the workload demand (Use Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template to provision the mix)
- Purchase **80 On-Demand Instances**. Provision additional On-Demand and Spot Instances per the workload demand (Use Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template to provision the mix)

---

## 1. In Simple English

The application runs on EC2 and usually needs 80 instances to function properly most of the time. Sometimes, it scales up to 300.

What’s the **cheapest way** to handle the **baseline of 80 instances**, while **still scaling** when needed?

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Reserved Instances (RIs)** are ideal for **predictable, long-running workloads**. They provide **significant cost savings** and are **guaranteed capacity**, unlike Spot.
- **Spot Instances** offer **deep discounts**, but AWS can **reclaim them at any time**, making them unsuitable for **critical steady workloads**.
- **Launch Templates** allow **mixing instance types and pricing models** (e.g., 60% Spot, 40% On-Demand) in Auto Scaling Groups — aligning with **best practices for elasticity and cost control**.
- AWS recommends this **3-tiered strategy** for EC2 capacity:
  - **Reserved** for steady state
  - **Spot** for opportunistic scale
  - **On-Demand** for gaps

### Question 'SAA-Q160'

A **startup** runs a **content management application** with:

- Web tier: **EC2 instances in `us-east-1`**
- Database tier: **Amazon Aurora in `us-east-1`**

European customers are experiencing **poor performance** due to distance-related latency.

Which of the following would you recommend to **improve performance**? (Select **two**)

- Create **Amazon Aurora read replicas in the eu-west-1 region**
- Set up another fleet of **EC2 instances** for the web tier in **eu-west-1**. Enable **failover routing policy** in Route 53
- Set up another fleet of **EC2 instances** for the web tier in **eu-west-1**. Enable **geolocation routing policy** in Route 53
- Create **Amazon Aurora Multi-AZ standby instance** in the eu-west-1 region
- Set up another fleet of **EC2 instances** for the web tier in **eu-west-1**. Enable **latency routing policy** in Route 53

---

## 1. In Simple English

Users in Europe are experiencing **slow access** because everything is hosted in the U.S. region.

To fix this:

- Add **local infrastructure** (EC2) in Europe
- Use **Route 53** to smartly route users based on location or latency
- Add **Aurora read replicas** closer to European users to **reduce read latency**

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Check **where the users are** and how far they are from the current infrastructure
- Use **latency-based routing** to direct traffic dynamically to closer regions
- For **read-heavy applications**, consider **Aurora cross-region replicas**
- Understand the distinction between **failover** (for DR) and **latency** (for performance)

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Cross-region read replicas** allow Aurora to replicate data asynchronously for **read scalability and regional performance**, especially useful for latency-sensitive read operations.
- **Route 53 Latency Routing Policy** dynamically routes users to the region that has the **lowest observed latency**, rather than their physical/geographic location.
- **Failover routing** is not designed for **performance**, but to redirect traffic **in case of service failure**.
- A **multi-region deployment** improves **resilience, fault isolation, and user experience**, especially for global applications — but must be paired with smart routing and replica strategies.

### Question 'SAA-Q161'

A **financial services company** needs to **store data in Amazon S3**, but must **manage encryption keys using an on-premises custom application**.

Which S3 encryption option satisfies these requirements?

- Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
- Client-Side Encryption with data encryption is done on the client-side before sending it to Amazon S3
- Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
- Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to store files in **S3**, but they **do not want AWS to manage encryption keys**.  
Instead, they use a **custom encryption key solution that runs on-premises**.

Which encryption method lets them keep control of their own keys?

- If the question says: **“Compliant with internal key infrastructure”** → AWS **must not store the key**
- Use **SSE-KMS** if customer is okay with AWS managing keys **with more auditing**
- Use **SSE-S3** only when there are **no custom key control requirements**

### Tip:

> SSE-C is a good choice when you want **S3 to encrypt/decrypt**, but **you supply the key** and AWS never stores it.

  - AWS **encrypts the object** using your key, but **never stores** the key
  - You **must provide the key** with each upload/download/delete request
  - Satisfies **stringent compliance** where **external key storage** is required
- **Client-Side Encryption** is another method where:
  - The application itself encrypts data **before uploading**
  - AWS S3 stores already-encrypted blobs
  - Requires custom decryption logic in all clients — not ideal for general-purpose S3 workflows
- **SSE-KMS and SSE-S3** are not suitable here because **AWS stores and manages the keys**, violating the requirement for **on-prem key management**

### Question 'SAA-Q162'

The Auto Scaling group (ASG) at a logistics company is **not terminating an unhealthy EC2 instance**.

As a Solutions Architect, which of the following could be **possible causes**? (Select **three**)

- The instance may be in Impaired status
- The instance has failed the ELB health check status
- The EC2 instance could be a spot instance type, which cannot be terminated by ASG
- The health check grace period for the instance has not expired
- A user updated the ASG configuration and increased the minimum number of instances, forcing ASG to keep unhealthy instances alive
- A custom health check might have failed. ASG does not terminate instances that are set unhealthy by custom checks

---

## 1. In Simple English

An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is supposed to replace unhealthy EC2 instances. In this case, it’s **not doing that** — and you’re being asked to pick **three reasons** why it might skip termination, based on how ASG evaluates instance health, timing, and config.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Ask yourself: _What triggers an ASG to replace an instance?_
- Consider whether ASG is **configured to detect** the failure (EC2 vs ELB)
- Check for any **timing buffers**, like **grace periods**
- Remember that **Impaired ≠ unhealthy**, and **Spot ≠ unmanageable**

### Tip:

> If the ASG isn’t acting, always verify:
>
> 1. The health check **type**
> 2. The **grace period**
> 3. The **status** (e.g., Impaired isn’t automatically "unhealthy")

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Grace Period**: Default is 300 seconds. Allows time for startup processes (e.g., init scripts, apps) to complete before ASG evaluates health.
- **ELB vs EC2 Health Checks**:
  - EC2: Based on instance status reports (e.g., reachability, impaired)
  - ELB: Based on load balancer target health status
- **Impaired State**:
  - Not immediately considered unhealthy
  - ASG waits for recovery unless instance fails permanently
- **Spot Instances**:
  - Fully compatible with ASG scaling, health check, and replacement mechanisms
- **Custom Health Checks**:
  - You can manually mark an instance as unhealthy using the CLI/API (`set-instance-health`) and ASG will terminate and replace it

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Ask: _What is the most direct way to monitor a resource and send a message?_
- Focus on **native integrations** that require **no code**.
- Eliminate services that require orchestration, compute, or custom logic.

### Tip:

> When a question says "LEAST amount of development effort", think **point-and-click** AWS services with built-in integrations.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **CloudWatch Alarms + SNS** is a **standard pattern** for automated alerting in AWS. You can set alarms on CPU, disk, network, etc., and notify teams via email, SMS, or HTTP.
- **SNS topics** can fan out alerts to **multiple subscribers** including email, SMS, Lambda, SQS, and even mobile apps.
- **SQS** is a decoupling mechanism — great for internal system messaging, but **not suitable** for user-facing notifications.
- **Lambda and Step Functions** are powerful, but **introduce overhead**. Use them only when you need logic or orchestration — not for basic alerting.

questionId: "saa-q164"
category: "Design Cost-Optimized Architectures"
tags: ["saa-c03", "ebs", "ec2", "deleteontermination", "instance-lifecycle", "storage"]

---

### Question 'SAA-Q164'

A junior DevOps engineer needs to **change the default configuration** so that an **EBS root volume persists** even after an EC2 instance terminates.

Which setting helps achieve this?

- Set the TerminateOnDelete attribute to true
- Set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to false
- Set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to true
- Set the TerminateOnDelete attribute to false

---

## 1. In Simple English

When an EC2 instance is terminated, its **root EBS volume is deleted by default**. The engineer wants to **keep the EBS root volume after termination**. You need to choose the **correct setting** that disables automatic deletion.

| **Set the TerminateOnDelete attribute to true**    | ❌ Incorrect | `TerminateOnDelete` is not a valid EC2/EBS attribute in AWS.                                                                                       |
| **Set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to false** | ✅ Correct   | This is the actual attribute that controls whether the root volume is deleted on instance termination. Setting it to **false** retains the volume. |
| **Set the DeleteOnTermination attribute to true**  | ❌ Incorrect | This ensures the volume **is deleted**, which is the default behavior.                                                                             |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- By default, when an EC2 instance is launched with an EBS root volume, that volume is marked with `"DeleteOnTermination": true`.
- You can modify this behavior via the EC2 console, AWS CLI, or CloudFormation by setting `DeleteOnTermination` to `false`.
- This is useful when you want to **retain logs, data, or OS snapshots** even after terminating the instance.
- The **attribute applies at the volume level**, not globally — so it can be set differently for each attached volume.

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Look for **correct order of operations** — many AWS flows are **strictly sequenced**
- Understand which actions require **disassociation first**
- Eliminate any options that mention **inviting or accepting** before **removal**

### Tip:

> You **cannot invite or accept** an account into a new org while it's still **attached to another**. Always detach first.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **AWS Organizations** allows for easy transfer of accounts between orgs using a **remove → invite → accept** pattern.
- The **management account** of the old org must first **remove** the member account.
- The **new org’s management account** can then issue an **invitation** using the account ID or email.
- The **invitation must be accepted** by signing into the account being moved.
- The process requires that the **member account has a payment method configured**, since it will be standalone briefly during the transition.

---

### Question 'SAA-Q166'

You have an **in-memory database launched on an EC2 instance** and want to **stop/start the instance without losing the in-memory state**.

What do you recommend?

- Mount an in-memory EBS Volume
- Use an EC2 Instance Store
- Use EC2 Instance Hibernate
- Create an AMI from the instance

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're running an EC2-based in-memory database and want to **retain what’s in RAM** when stopping and starting the instance — essentially, **not lose memory state** during stop/start cycles.

| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mount an in-memory EBS Volume**   | ❌ Incorrect | EBS is persistent storage, not RAM. There is no such thing as an “in-memory” EBS volume.                                            |
| **Use an EC2 Instance Store**       | ❌ Incorrect | Instance store is ephemeral disk storage, not memory. It doesn't persist RAM state.                                                 |
| **Use EC2 Instance Hibernate**      | ✅ Correct   | Hibernate saves the instance’s memory (RAM) contents to EBS and restores it on restart. Perfect for preserving in-memory databases. |
| **Create an AMI from the instance** | ❌ Incorrect | AMIs capture disk (volume) state, not memory contents. In-memory data is lost.                                                      |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Focus on **volatile vs persistent** memory
- Know which features preserve **RAM**, not just **disk**
- Eliminate anything related to **storage** when the question is about **in-memory state**

### Tip:

> Look for the **keyword "in-memory"** — the only EC2 feature that saves RAM content across restarts is **hibernate**.

| Not suitable for memory                       | ❌ Instance store, ❌ AMI |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **EC2 Hibernate** works by **saving RAM contents to the root EBS volume** when the instance is stopped. Upon restart, the instance resumes **exactly where it left off**, including in-memory state.
- Hibernate is ideal for **in-memory databases**, **custom caches**, or **stateful applications** that would otherwise take long to reload.
- Hibernate requires:

  - Supported instance types (e.g., `t3`, `m5`, `c5`, etc.)
  - HVM AMIs
  - Encrypted root volumes
  - Less than 150 GB RAM

- **AMIs** only capture the **disk image** and launch configuration — they do **not** capture memory state.
- **Instance Store volumes** are often confused with RAM because they’re **ephemeral**, but they’re not memory-based.

| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Run the workload on Spot Instances**     | ⚠️ Partially Correct | Spot is low-cost, but single spot instance usage is vulnerable to interruptions.                                                                                |
| **Run the workload on Dedicated Hosts**    | ❌ Incorrect         | Dedicated hosts are expensive and reserved for licensing/compliance needs.                                                                                      |
| **Run the workload on Reserved Instances** | ❌ Incorrect         | RIs are cost-effective for **long-term, steady** workloads, not short jobs.                                                                                     |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Spot Instances** offer up to 90% savings but can be **terminated at any time** with 2-minute warning.
- **Spot Fleet** uses multiple Spot capacity pools (e.g., across instance types and AZs), **mitigating the risk of interruption**.
- You can use **allocation strategies** like `capacityOptimized` or `lowestPrice` to guide how the fleet provisions capacity.
- For distributed workloads like Hadoop/Spark, Spot Fleets are ideal because they can scale up cheap compute fast and recover from node loss automatically.
- Reserved and Dedicated instances are **inappropriate for bursty workloads** due to cost and overcommitment risk.

| **Use EC2 User-Data**                                     | ❌ Incorrect | User-data scripts help with provisioning on first launch, not with reducing restart time.                                                                |
| **Create an AMI and launch your EC2 instances from that** | ❌ Incorrect | AMIs reduce instance provisioning time but don’t affect app boot time after restarts.                                                                    |
| **Use EC2 Meta-Data**                                     | ❌ Incorrect | EC2 metadata provides information about the instance — it has nothing to do with boot performance.                                                       |
| **Use EC2 Instance Hibernate**                            | ✅ Correct   | Hibernate preserves the contents of memory (RAM). On restart, the instance resumes exactly where it left off — eliminating the 3-minute bootstrap delay. |

questionId: "saa-q170"
category: "Design Secure Architectures"
tags: ["saa-c03", "s3", "cross-account", "redshift", "object-ownership", "bucket-permissions"]

---

### Question 'SAA-Q170'

A **Redshift cluster writes files into an Amazon S3 bucket owned by a different AWS account**. However, the **bucket owner cannot access the objects**.

What is the **most likely reason**?

- The owner of an S3 bucket has implicit access to all objects in their bucket. Permissions are set after upload.
- When objects are uploaded to an S3 bucket from a different account, the bucket owner gets implicit permissions.
- By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it. The bucket owner does not have implicit access.
- Both AWS accounts must share bucket policies. An erroneous policy can cause permission failures.

---

## 1. In Simple English

An S3 bucket belongs to one AWS account, but another account uploads files to it — and now the bucket owner **cannot open or read the files**. You need to find the **best explanation** for this problem.

| **The owner of an S3 bucket has implicit access to all objects in their bucket. Permissions are set after upload.**        | ❌ Incorrect                      | Bucket owners do **not** automatically gain access to objects uploaded by others. S3 object-level permissions are based on **object ownership**.                                                |
| **When objects are uploaded to an S3 bucket from a different account, the bucket owner gets implicit permissions.**        | ❌ Incorrect                      | There are **no implicit permissions granted** to the bucket owner.

| **By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it. The bucket owner does not have implicit access.** | ✅ Correct                        | This is the root issue — unless permissions or ownership are explicitly configured (e.g., via bucket policy, ACLs, or Object Ownership), the **uploader retains access**, not the bucket owner. |
| **Both AWS accounts must share bucket policies. An erroneous policy can cause permission failures.**                       | ⚠️ Partially True but Not Primary | While policies do affect access, **object ownership is the fundamental issue here**. A correct policy will not override ownership without ACL or bucket ownership configuration.                |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Object Ownership** in S3 determines who controls the object — **not** the bucket owner by default.
- AWS provides a setting called **Bucket Owner Enforced (BOE)** to automatically transfer ownership to the bucket owner when objects are uploaded.
- Without enabling BOE or configuring ACLs, a bucket owner **cannot access** objects uploaded by another account — even if it's their own bucket.
- The best practice in cross-account scenarios is to enable **S3 Object Ownership** with **ACLs disabled** and use **BOE** for consistency and simplicity.

### Question 'SAA-Q171'

A **tax computation software** runs behind a **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** and **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**. Computation tasks can take **up to 10 minutes** to complete.

How can you **prevent requests from being interrupted during a scale-in event**?

- Create an ASG Scheduled Action
- Enable ELB health checks on the ASG
- Enable Stickiness on the CLB
- Increase the deregistration delay to more than 10 minutes

---

## 1. In Simple English

Your app runs long tasks (10 minutes) and sits behind a CLB and ASG. When Auto Scaling scales in and terminates an instance, you want to make sure **existing tasks are not cut off** during that process.

### Strategy:

- Identify whether the problem is **request loss**, **latency**, or **routing**
- Match the behavior to **load balancer or scaling controls**
- Look for delay/grace-period/lifecycle options if **shutdown timing** is involved

### Tip:

> If your workload is stateful or long-running, always ask: “How do I give the instance enough time to finish before termination?”

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Deregistration delay** applies during **scale-in** events to help applications finish ongoing requests. For CLB, this value can be set **up to 3600 seconds (1 hour)**.
- During this period, the **instance is marked as “deregistering”** and **no new requests** are sent to it, but existing connections can complete.
- Best practice: Set the **deregistration delay to the maximum task runtime**, and implement **connection draining**.
- Other load balancer types (ALB/NLB) also support similar draining behavior through **target group settings**.

- Partition placement group
- Spread placement group
- Both Spread and Partition placement groups

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company is moving a **large Hadoop-style distributed job** to AWS and wants it to be **highly available**, using **lots of EC2 instances** (50 per AZ). You need to pick the **best placement strategy** that supports scale and minimizes risk of failure.

| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster placement group**                    | ❌ Incorrect | Cluster groups are optimized for **low latency**, not availability. Also, they are not ideal for fault isolation or large numbers (like 50 per AZ).                           |
| **Partition placement group**                  | ✅ Correct   | Designed for large distributed systems like Hadoop. Partitions isolate groups of EC2 instances across **racks and AZs**, reducing failure impact and maximizing availability. |
| **Spread placement group**                     | ❌ Incorrect | Spread groups are limited to **7 instances per AZ**, and designed for **critical, small-scale apps**, not massive clusters.                                                   |
| **Both Spread and Partition placement groups** | ❌ Incorrect | You can only choose one placement group per instance. Also, combining them conceptually doesn't fit the workload's size and nature.                                           |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Look at **scale** (dozens vs few instances)
- Look at **resilience** vs **performance**
- Match **architecture pattern** (distributed, HA, or real-time) to the right placement model

### Tip:

> If the question involves **distributed systems with many EC2s**, think **Partition**. If it's **critical small components**, think **Spread**. If it's **ultra-low latency**, think **Cluster**.

| Low latency, tight networking    | ❌ Cluster           |
| Small-scale, critical apps       | ❌ Spread            |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Partition placement groups** divide instances across partitions, which map to **separate racks or failure zones** within each AZ.
- This reduces the **blast radius** of hardware failure.
- Ideal for horizontally scaled systems like **Hadoop**, **HDFS**, **Kafka**, or **Cassandra**.
- Contrast:
  - **Cluster** = performance (not HA)
  - **Spread** = max fault isolation, but small footprint
  - **Partition** = balance of **scale** and **isolation**

questionId: "saa-q174"
category: "Design Secure Architectures"
tags: ["saa-c03", "security-group", "alb", "rds", "postgresql", "ec2", "networking"]

---

### Question 'SAA-Q174'

An **HTTP application** is deployed behind an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and accesses a **PostgreSQL RDS database**.

How should you **configure the security groups**? (Select **three**)

- The security group of RDS should have an inbound rule from the security group of the EC2 instances in the ASG on port 80
- The security group of the EC2 instances should have an inbound rule from the security group of the RDS database on port 5432
- The security group of RDS should have an inbound rule from the security group of the EC2 instances in the ASG on port 5432
- The security group of the ALB should have an inbound rule from anywhere on port 443
- The security group of the ALB should have an inbound rule from anywhere on port 80
- The security group of the EC2 instances should have an inbound rule from the security group of the ALB on port 80

---

## 1. In Simple English

This is a **3-tier architecture**:

- A client sends HTTP traffic to the ALB
- The ALB forwards traffic to EC2 instances in an ASG
- The EC2 app connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted on RDS

You must **configure Security Groups** correctly to allow traffic through each layer.

## 4. Answer and Explanation (Table)

✅ **Correct Answers:**

- **The security group of RDS should have an inbound rule from the security group of the EC2 instances in the ASG on port 5432**
- **The security group of the ALB should have an inbound rule from anywhere on port 80**
- **The security group of the EC2 instances should have an inbound rule from the security group of the ALB on port 80**

| Option                                           | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **RDS inbound rule from EC2 SG on port 80**      | ❌ Incorrect | RDS uses port **5432** for PostgreSQL, not 80.                                 |
| **EC2 SG has inbound from RDS SG on port 5432**  | ❌ Incorrect | EC2 is the **initiator** here; RDS needs inbound rule. This rule does nothing. |
| **RDS SG has inbound from EC2 SG on port 5432**  | ✅ Correct   | EC2 connects to RDS, so RDS must **accept** connections on port 5432.          |
| **ALB SG has inbound from anywhere on port 443** | ❌ Incorrect | App is using **HTTP**, not HTTPS. Port 443 is unused unless SSL is in use.     |
| **ALB SG has inbound from anywhere on port 80**  | ✅ Correct   | ALB must accept HTTP requests from the public internet.                        |
| **EC2 SG has inbound from ALB SG on port 80**    | ✅ Correct   | ALB needs to forward traffic to EC2 — so EC2’s SG must allow port 80 from ALB. |

## 5. Final Answer

✅

- **The security group of RDS should have an inbound rule from the security group of the EC2 instances in the ASG on port 5432**
- **The security group of the ALB should have an inbound rule from anywhere on port 80**
- **The security group of the EC2 instances should have an inbound rule from the security group of the ALB on port 80**

| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| RDS allows port 80 from EC2 | ❌ Invalid    | Wrong port entirely             |
| EC2 allows from RDS         | ⚠️ Misleading | Direction of rule is wrong      |

| EC2 allows from ALB         | ✅ Essential  | Required for ALB-to-EC2 routing |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Identify **who is the client and who is the server**
- Write **inbound rules** on the **server’s** SG to allow only traffic from the **client’s SG**
- Use correct **ports per service** (HTTP: 80, PostgreSQL: 5432)

### Tip:

> Draw the flow: **Internet → ALB → EC2 → RDS**, and set security group **inbound rules in reverse**

---

## 9. Technology Deep Dive (Table)

| Component | Who Connects To It | Required Inbound Rule | Port              |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| ALB       | Internet           | Anywhere → ALB        | 80 (HTTP)         |
| EC2       | ALB                | ALB SG → EC2 SG       | 80                |
| RDS       | EC2                | EC2 SG → RDS SG       | 5432 (PostgreSQL) |

---

## 10. Summary Table (Conclusion)

| Correct Configuration     | Justification             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| RDS allows EC2 SG on 5432 | EC2 initiates DB traffic  |
| ALB allows anywhere on 80 | Public HTTP entrypoint    |
| EC2 allows ALB SG on 80   | ALB forwards HTTP traffic |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Security groups are stateful**: If an inbound rule allows traffic, the return response is automatically allowed.
- Security group rules are **not bidirectional** — each direction must be explicitly defined.
- **Database ports** vary by engine:
  - PostgreSQL → 5432
  - MySQL → 3306
- **ALB SGs** should expose **public-facing ports**, typically **80 or 443**.
- Security group **references** (using source SG instead of IP range) are preferred for dynamic scaling (e.g., ASG or ALB targets).

### Question 'SAA-Q175'

Given the following IAM policy, what action is permitted?

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Mystery Policy",
      "Action": ["ec2:RunInstances"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": "eu-west-1"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- It allows running EC2 instances only in the eu-west-1 region, and the API call can be made from anywhere in the world
- It allows to run EC2 instances in the eu-west-1 region, when the API call is made from the eu-west-1 region
- It allows running EC2 instances in any region when the API call is originating from the eu-west-1 region
- It allows running EC2 instances anywhere but in the eu-west-1 region

---

## 1. In Simple English

This IAM policy says: “You can run EC2 instances **only if the requested region is eu-west-1**.”
It doesn’t matter **where the user is**, just where the EC2 instance is being launched.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **It allows running EC2 instances only in the eu-west-1 region, and the API call can be made from anywhere in the world** | ✅ Correct   | The policy limits **where** the EC2 instance is being launched. It does **not** check where the user is calling from. |
| **It allows to run EC2 instances in the eu-west-1 region, when the API call is made from the eu-west-1 region**           | ❌ Incorrect | IAM condition key `aws:RequestedRegion` checks the **target region** — not caller IP or physical location.            |
| **It allows running EC2 instances in any region when the API call is originating from the eu-west-1 region**              | ❌ Incorrect | The opposite of what the policy does — it limits the launch region, not the source of the API call.                   |
| **It allows running EC2 instances anywhere but in the eu-west-1 region**                                                  | ❌ Incorrect | This is backwards — the policy explicitly **allows only eu-west-1**, denying all others implicitly.                   |

| Anywhere but eu-west-1     | ❌ Wrong    | The policy is an allow, not a deny — inverts the logic |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Ask yourself: **Which attribute is this IAM policy condition checking?**
- Is it the **region of the action**, the **caller’s location**, or something else?
- Learn common condition keys like `aws:SourceIp`, `aws:PrincipalOrgID`, and `aws:RequestedRegion`

> `aws:RequestedRegion` = _Where you want to do the thing_,
> not _where you're calling from_.

| Caller in Europe but targets us-east-1 | ❌ Denied  |
| Caller in Asia targeting eu-west-1     | ✅ Allowed |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- IAM condition keys like `aws:RequestedRegion` are critical for enforcing **region-specific compliance**, such as:

  - GDPR requirements (Europe-only data residency)
  - Corporate data sovereignty

- These conditions evaluate **what the request is trying to do**, not who is making the request (unless paired with another key like `aws:PrincipalArn`)
- Best practice:

  - Use `aws:RequestedRegion` in **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** for Org-wide enforcement
  - Combine with `aws:PrincipalOrgID` for tighter control across multiple accounts

tags: ["saa-c03", "api-gateway", "amazon-cognito", "authentication", "authorization", "user-management"]

---

### Question 'SAA-Q176'

You are advising a company on authentication and authorization mechanisms for **API Gateway**. They want **built-in user management**.

Which is the best fit for this use case?

Single answer:

- Use Amazon Cognito User Pools
- Use AWS_IAM authorization
- Use Amazon Cognito Identity Pools
- Use API Gateway Lambda authorizer

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to protect an API and also **manage users directly within AWS**, like signing up users, handling logins, password resets, etc.

You need to choose the authentication method that gives you **user directories and user management** without custom code.

| **Use Amazon Cognito User Pools**     | ✅ Correct   | User Pools are designed for **user authentication** and provide **sign-up, login, token issuance**, and user profile management — directly integrated with API Gateway. |
| **Use AWS_IAM authorization**         | ❌ Incorrect | IAM authorization is for **service-to-service** or internal use. It does not manage users.                                                                              |
| **Use Amazon Cognito Identity Pools** | ❌ Incorrect | Identity Pools are used for **temporary AWS credentials** — they don't handle sign-up or sign-in.                                                                       |
| **Use API Gateway Lambda authorizer** | ❌ Incorrect | This allows custom authorization logic (e.g., JWT verification), but **doesn’t provide user management out-of-the-box**.                                                |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- First, ask: _Does the company want AWS to handle the users (sign-up, login)?_
- If yes → Choose **Cognito User Pools**
- If no and you want custom logic → Use **Lambda Authorizers**
- IAM is only for internal AWS access control — **not for app users**

| Option                 | User Management | Best Fit for Use Case |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Cognito User Pools     | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Best choice        |
| Cognito Identity Pools | ❌ No           | ❌ Not suitable       |
| AWS IAM                | ❌ No           | ❌ Internal use only  |
| Lambda Authorizer      | ❌ No           | ❌ Overkill here      |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Cognito User Pools** allow you to:
  - Sign up users with email/phone
  - Handle password reset flows
  - Send tokens (ID, access, refresh)
  - Configure app clients and scopes
- They integrate **natively with API Gateway** for token-based access
- They support **OAuth2, OpenID Connect**, and **federated identity providers** like Google, Facebook, etc.
- When used with API Gateway, the Authorization header expects a **JWT from Cognito**
- **Identity Pools** are used _after_ authentication to provide AWS service access — not for sign-in flows

### Question 'SAA-Q177'

You want to **mount a network file system on Linux instances**, where files will be **frequently accessed at first**, then **accessed infrequently** later.

What is the **MOST cost-effective** AWS storage solution?

Single answer:

- FSx for Lustre
- EFS IA
- S3 Intelligent Tiering
- Glacier Deep Archive

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're setting up a file system for Linux servers. The files will be used a lot in the beginning, and then barely touched after that. You want the **cheapest storage** that can still be **mounted like a network file system**.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Ask yourself: _Does it need to be mounted like a file system?_
- If yes → Focus on **EFS or FSx**
- Then ask: _How often is the data accessed?_
- If mostly infrequent → Go with **EFS IA** (if Linux-compatible and POSIX required)

### Tip:

> If the question says “Linux instances” and “mounted”, that’s your clue it’s **not S3** or **Glacier**. Then focus on **EFS** options.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon EFS IA** is an **NFS file system** that:
  - Is **mountable** on EC2 (Linux)
  - Uses lifecycle management to move files to IA
  - Costs **as little as 1/10th** of standard EFS for infrequent access
- **S3 Intelligent Tiering** is **not a mountable filesystem**, and works better for applications coded to access S3 directly
- **FSx for Lustre** is very fast, great for burst compute, but **not cost-efficient** for long-lived, low-access workloads

### Question 'SAA-Q178'

**EC2 Auto Scaling** must terminate an instance from **Availability Zone us-east-1a**, which currently has **4 instances**.

Which instance will be terminated **based on the default termination policy**?

Single answer:

- Instance A
- Instance B
- Instance C
- Instance D

---

## 1. In Simple English

The question is asking:

> “When Auto Scaling Group (ASG) decides to terminate an instance **based on default settings**, which **specific instance** will it choose from a group in one AZ?”

You don’t need to guess which letter — just know **what logic ASG uses** by default to pick which instance to terminate.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Auto Scaling Default Termination Policy** aims for:
  - **Zonal balance**: Terminate from the AZ with the most instances
  - **Lifecycle order**: Oldest instance is targeted to reduce potential for drift or config changes
- **Custom termination policies** can override this (e.g., prioritizing Spot first, or instance weight)
- **Instance protection** can exempt instances from being terminated even if old or in AZ with many instances

### Question 'SAA-Q179'

You want to rollout a **blue-green deployment globally within 48 hours**, but **DNS caching on mobile devices** is a concern.

What solution is **best for controlled traffic shifting**?

Single answer:

- Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute traffic
- Use AWS CodeDeploy deployment options
- Use Route 53 weighted routing to spread traffic
- Use Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're launching a **new version of your app (green)** while keeping the **old one (blue)** live.

You want to gradually shift users over — but DNS caching on mobile devices means **you can't rely on fast DNS updates**.  
So which AWS tool helps you **control traffic flow directly** (not relying on DNS TTLs)?

| CodeDeploy                | ⚠️ Misleading | Blue-green sounds relevant, but CodeDeploy is only local, not global    |
| Route 53 weighted routing | ⚠️ Tempting   | Often used for traffic shifting, but limited by **client-side caching** |
| Elastic Load Balancer     | ❌ Invalid    | Doesn’t help with global distribution or DNS independence               |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Ask: _“Can I rely on DNS?”_ If **no**, look for **IP-based** or **network-layer** solutions.
- Know that **Route 53 = DNS-based**, so TTL caching will delay changes.
- **Global Accelerator = fast rerouting**, ideal when DNS can’t be trusted (e.g., mobile apps)

### Tip:

> If DNS caching is mentioned as a problem, **Global Accelerator is the safest, most precise traffic control option**.

| Requirement                        | Best Option        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Global rollout with fast switching | Global Accelerator |
| Avoid DNS caching delays           | Global Accelerator |
| In-place application deployment    | CodeDeploy         |
| Global routing based on weights    | Route 53           |
| Regional traffic distribution      | ELB                |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Global Accelerator** uses static **anycast IPs** to route user traffic to the nearest healthy endpoint, avoiding DNS-based pitfalls.
- **DNS caching** is especially persistent on **mobile carriers**, and even lowering TTL may not help.
- **Blue-green deployments** benefit from tools that allow **precise routing control**, like:
  - Global Accelerator
  - Service Mesh (App Mesh)
  - Weighted target groups (but these are regional)
- **Route 53 TTLs** are advisory. Clients (especially mobile apps) may ignore short TTLs.
- **Global Accelerator + ALB** is a powerful pattern for traffic redirection without DNS reliance.

| Option                          | Trickiness     | Why It’s Tricky                                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overlapping zones               | ⚠️ Tempting    | Sounds valid but not a blocking factor                    |
| Conflicting resolver rules      | ❌ Misleading  | Not an actual AWS term or setting                         |
| Enable DNS hostnames/resolution | ✅ Clear       | Necessary to make private DNS work                        |
| NS and SOA record fixes         | ⚠️ Distracting | Valid for delegation, but unrelated to VPC DNS resolution |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Check whether the issue is **inside a VPC** — if so, look at **VPC settings first**
- Look for **keywords** like “unresolved” or “EC2 can’t resolve” → points to VPC DNS flags
- Disregard zone record types (like NS/SOA) unless DNS delegation is involved

### Tip:

> Always enable both **DNS resolution** and **DNS hostnames** in your VPC settings for Private Hosted Zones to work.

| Setting            | Purpose                                           | Required for Private Hosted Zone? |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| DNS Resolution     | Allows VPC to resolve names using Amazon DNS      | ✅ Yes                            |
| DNS Hostnames      | Allows instances to have DNS names inside the VPC | ✅ Yes                            |
| NS and SOA Records | Control DNS delegation and zone metadata          | ❌ No                             |
| Overlapping Zones  | May cause confusion, but not fatal                | ❌ No                             |

## 10. Summary Table (Conclusion)

| Key Configuration       | Must Be Set     |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| DNS Resolution in VPC   | ✅ Yes          |
| DNS Hostnames in VPC    | ✅ Yes          |
| NS/SOA Record Tuning    | ❌ No           |
| Namespace Overlap Fixes | ❌ Not Required |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Private Hosted Zones** are only resolvable **within the associated VPC**.
- These zones rely on **AmazonProvidedDNS**, which in turn depends on two VPC settings:
  - `enableDnsSupport`: Allows DNS resolution using AWS DNS
  - `enableDnsHostnames`: Assigns DNS names to EC2 instances
- If either of these is disabled, **name resolution fails** even if Route 53 is correctly configured.
- NS and SOA records are primarily for **delegation** (used in public DNS scenarios) and do not affect resolution from within a VPC.
- This is a **classic interview and exam trap** — the right fix is in the VPC settings, not the zone itself.

### Question 'SAA-Q188'

An **Aurora database cluster** is experiencing **high read I/O**, causing **latency**.

What is the **recommended solution**?

- Activate read-through caching on the Aurora database
- Set up a read replica and modify the application to use the appropriate endpoint
- Configure the application to read from the Multi-AZ standby instance
- Provision another Amazon Aurora database and link it as a read replica

| **Activate read-through caching on the Aurora database**                             | ❌ Incorrect | Aurora does not support automatic read-through caching natively. This option is vague and not an Aurora feature.                                                   |
| **Set up a read replica and modify the application to use the appropriate endpoint** | ✅ Correct   | Aurora supports **read replicas** for scaling reads. You must direct the app to the **Aurora Reader Endpoint**, which automatically load-balances across replicas. |
| **Configure the application to read from the Multi-AZ standby instance**             | ❌ Incorrect | Multi-AZ standby is for failover only. It doesn’t accept read traffic under normal conditions.                                                                     |
| **Provision another Amazon Aurora database and link it as a read replica**           | ❌ Incorrect | You don’t need to create a new Aurora DB from scratch; Aurora makes it easy to spin up **native read replicas** within the same cluster.                           |

### Question 'SAA-Q189'

A **healthcare client** needs a **cost-optimized data lake** solution.

What **two strategies** should you recommend?

- Setup a lifecycle policy to transition the refined zone data into Glacier Deep Archive after 1 day
- Use Glue ETL job to write the transformed data in the refined zone using a compressed file format
- Use Glue ETL job to write the transformed data in the refined zone using CSV format
- Setup a lifecycle policy to transition the raw zone data into Glacier Deep Archive after 1 day of object creation
- Create a Lambda function based job to delete the raw zone data after 1 day

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're helping a healthcare company save money on their **data lake**.  
They collect raw data, clean and transform it into refined data, and store both in Amazon S3.  
You need to **reduce cost** — especially for data that is rarely accessed.

## 4. Answer and Explanation (Table)

✅ **Correct Answers:**

- **Use Glue ETL job to write the transformed data in the refined zone using a compressed file format**
- **Setup a lifecycle policy to transition the raw zone data into Glacier Deep Archive after 1 day of object creation**

| Option                                                                                                                | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Setup a lifecycle policy to transition the refined zone data into Glacier Deep Archive after 1 day**                | ❌ Incorrect | Refined data may still be used for analytics or queries soon after creation; archiving it after 1 day is too aggressive. |
| **Use Glue ETL job to write the transformed data in the refined zone using a compressed file format**                 | ✅ Correct   | Using formats like Parquet or ORC reduces storage size and improves query performance.                                   |
| **Use Glue ETL job to write the transformed data in the refined zone using CSV format**                               | ❌ Incorrect | CSV is uncompressed, inefficient, and not cost-optimized.                                                                |
| **Setup a lifecycle policy to transition the raw zone data into Glacier Deep Archive after 1 day of object creation** | ✅ Correct   | Raw data is rarely accessed after processing. Moving it to cold storage quickly saves cost.                              |
| **Create a Lambda function based job to delete the raw zone data after 1 day**                                        | ❌ Incorrect | Deleting raw data after 1 day may violate data retention requirements. Lifecycle transition is safer and cheaper.        |

---

### Question 'SAA-Q190'

Which IAM policy provides **read-only access** to the S3 bucket `'mybucket'` and its content?

- Policy that grants `s3:ListBucket` on `'arn:aws:s3:::mybucket'` and `s3:GetObject` on `'arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*'`
- Policy that grants `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` both on `'arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*'`
- Policy that grants `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` both on `'arn:aws:s3:::mybucket'`
- Policy that grants `s3:ListBucket` on `'arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*'` and `s3:GetObject` on `'arn:aws:s3:::mybucket'`

---

## 1. In Simple English

You need to write a **read-only IAM policy** that lets a user:

- **List** the contents of a bucket (see file names)
- **Read** the objects (download/view files) in the bucket

The bucket is named `'mybucket'`.

- **S3 resource types**:
  - Bucket: `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name`
  - Object: `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/key-name`
- For **read-only access**, both `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` are needed
- Common pattern used in **IAM roles for EC2**, **Athena access**, and **Lambda functions**
- AWS provides a **managed read-only policy**: `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` — which uses this same structure
- You can add **conditions** like `aws:SourceIp` or `aws:RequestedRegion` to restrict further if needed

### Question 'SAA-Q192'

A company needs **cost-effective file storage** for **less frequently accessed files** that can be **concurrently accessed by hundreds of EC2 instances**.

What is the **best solution**?

- Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) Standard storage class
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class
- Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) Standard–IA storage class

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants:

- **Shared access** to the same files across **many EC2s**
- Files are **not accessed frequently**
- They want to **save money**

Which AWS storage fits all these needs?

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **EFS Standard–IA** is ideal for workloads that:

  - Need shared access
  - Access files rarely
  - Want automatic cost savings

- **Access pattern-aware**: AWS automatically moves files between Standard and IA based on access frequency.

- **EC2 applications** often require **file-level semantics**, which only EFS (not S3 or EBS) provides with shared access.

- S3 is best for web objects, static assets, and backup — not for shared application file systems.

---

### Question 'SAA-Q193'

**Kinesis Agent** is configured to send **IoT data** to a **Firehose delivery stream** that is already **sourced from Kinesis Data Streams**.

Why is the data **not reaching Firehose**?

- Kinesis Agent can only write to Kinesis Data Streams, not to Kinesis Firehose
- Kinesis Agent cannot write to a Kinesis Firehose for which the delivery stream source is already set as Kinesis Data Streams
- Kinesis Firehose delivery stream has reached its limit
- The data sent by Kinesis Agent is lost because of a configuration error

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're using **Kinesis Agent** to send data directly to a **Kinesis Firehose** stream.

But this Firehose is already configured to **receive data from another Kinesis Data Stream**.

Why is **your new data** not arriving?

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Firehose Source Restrictions**:

  - You can configure a delivery stream to source data from:
    - A **Kinesis Data Stream**, or
    - Direct input (e.g., **Kinesis Agent**, **PutRecord API**, etc.)
  - **You cannot use both** at the same time.

- If your delivery stream is **sourced from Kinesis Data Streams**, data must flow:

### Question 'SAA-Q194'

Which are **true about EC2 User Data behavior**? (Select **two**)

- By default, user data is executed every time an instance is restarted
- When an instance is running, you can update user data by using root user credentials
- By default, scripts entered as user data are executed with root user privileges
- By default, user data runs only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance

---

## 1. In Simple English

This question tests your knowledge of how **EC2 user data** works — the scripts you attach when launching an instance.  
You need to identify **two behaviors** that are **true by default**.

- **By default, user data runs only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance**

| Option                                                                                      | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **By default, user data is executed every time an instance is restarted**                   | ❌ Incorrect | EC2 user data runs **once**, at the first boot. It does **not** run on every reboot unless specifically configured to do so. |
| **When an instance is running, you can update user data by using root user credentials**    | ❌ Incorrect | User data is **set at launch**. You can **update it via EC2 console or API**, not from within the running instance directly. |
| **By default, scripts entered as user data are executed with root user privileges**         | ✅ Correct   | The EC2 user data script is run as **root**, so it can perform administrative setup tasks.                                   |
| **By default, user data runs only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance** | ✅ Correct   | User data scripts run once — during the **first boot** of the EC2 instance.                                                  |

| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Runs every restart | ⚠️ Common myth | Requires cloud-init tweaks to repeat execution |
| Update via root    | ❌ Invalid     | Root cannot update EC2 metadata like user data |
| Root execution     | ✅ True        | Frequently needed for setup tasks              |
| Runs only once     | ✅ Subtle      | Misconception exists about repetition          |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Ask: _“When and how does EC2 user data run?”_
- Recall: it’s a **one-time bootstrap**, unless overridden
- Understand the **execution context** (runs as root)

### Tip:

> To make user data scripts **run on every reboot**, you must write them to `/etc/rc.local` or configure `/var/lib/cloud/instance/`.

---

### Question 'SAA-Q195'

The company needs **user-level and account-level access control** for **S3 resources**.  
What is the **most optimized solution**?

- Use IAM Policies
- Use Security Groups
- Use Amazon S3 Bucket Policies
- Use Access Control Lists (ACLs)

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to **control who can access S3 buckets and objects**, both for **users in their own AWS account** and **users in other AWS accounts**.  
You need to find the solution that supports **fine-grained permissions** and **cross-account access**, with minimal complexity.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Ask: _Does it require cross-account access?_ If yes, IAM Policies alone are not enough.
- Ask: _Is it for networking (like EC2) or object storage?_ Security Groups are irrelevant for S3.
- Prefer **Bucket Policies** over ACLs for modern security controls.

### Tip:

> If access must span **multiple AWS accounts**, always lean on **Bucket Policies** — they're scalable and secure.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **S3 Bucket Policies** allow conditions like `aws:username` or `aws:PrincipalArn` for **fine-grained user access**, and can specify `Principal` for **cross-account permissions**.
- **IAM Policies** only work for resources and users **in the same AWS account**.
- **ACLs** are a legacy tool, allow limited access, and **should generally be avoided** for new applications.
- **Security Groups** are **not applicable to S3** — they only manage **network traffic**, not object access.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **RDS Multi-AZ** offers **synchronous replication** and **automatic failover**, improving uptime with minimal changes.
- **RDS Read Replicas** are **asynchronous**, must be promoted manually, and do not guarantee no data loss.
- **Cross-region setups** are for **resilience against full region failure**, which is **not necessary for standard HA**.
- **High Availability (HA)** is best achieved with **Multi-AZ architectures**, not cross-region unless explicitly required.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Know that **encryption is set at DB creation time** and can't be toggled casually
- **Encrypted masters must have encrypted replicas**
- **Unencrypted masters cannot have encrypted replicas**

### Tip:

> Think of encryption as a trait that must match between primary and replica — AWS doesn’t allow mismatched encryption states.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Encryption is defined at the DB cluster or instance level** and is immutable once set.
- To move from unencrypted → encrypted, you must:
  1. Take a snapshot of the unencrypted DB
  2. Copy the snapshot with encryption enabled
  3. Restore a new encrypted DB from that snapshot
- **Read replicas inherit encryption state** from the source DB. AWS enforces this to prevent insecure replication paths.

---

### Question 'SAA-Q198'

Which solution ensures each desktop system's **telemetry data is processed independently and in order**?

- Use an SQS FIFO queue, and send telemetry data as is
- Use a Kinesis Data Stream with Partition ID as Desktop ID
- Use an SQS FIFO queue, and use a Group ID representing the Desktop ID
- Use an SQS standard queue, and send telemetry data as is

---

## 1. In Simple English

You want to make sure:

- Each desktop’s data is **handled in order**
- Data from **one desktop doesn’t mix with others**

You need a messaging solution that **preserves order within each device**.

## 4. Answer and Explanation (Table)

✅ **Correct Answer:**

- **Use an SQS FIFO queue, and use a Group ID representing the Desktop ID**

| Option                                     | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQS FIFO, send as-is**                   | ❌ Incorrect | Without a Group ID, SQS FIFO cannot differentiate streams by desktop — no ordering per source |
| **Kinesis with Partition ID = Desktop ID** | ⚠️ Possible  | Works, but Kinesis is more complex and not mentioned as a _FIFO queue_ — less optimal here    |
| **SQS FIFO + Group ID = Desktop ID**       | ✅ Correct   | Group ID enables **per-desktop ordering** in FIFO queues — exactly what’s needed              |
| **SQS standard queue, send as-is**         | ❌ Incorrect | Standard queues offer **best-effort ordering** — no guarantee                                 |

| SQS FIFO with Group ID per Desktop | ✅ Ideal     | Precisely fits the use case                    |
| SQS Standard                       | ❌ Invalid   | No ordering guarantee — breaks the requirement |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- Look for **order + independence** ➝ use **FIFO + Group ID**
- Look for **scale + low latency** ➝ consider **Kinesis + partition key**
- Avoid **Standard SQS** when strict order is critical

### Tip:

> If you're trying to keep telemetry grouped and ordered, **SQS FIFO with Group ID** gives perfect fit — each Group ID gets a separate ordered stream.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Message Group ID** in SQS FIFO:
  - Ensures **ordering per group** (in this case, per desktop)
  - Messages with the same Group ID are processed in order
- **Kinesis Partition Key** provides **similar guarantees** but adds operational overhead (e.g., managing shards, throughput, scaling)
- **Standard SQS** is not appropriate for strict ordering — only use when throughput matters more than sequence

category: "Design Secure Architectures"
tags: ["saa-c03", "security-groups", "web-tier", "private-database", "ec2", "least-privilege", "networking"]

---

### Question 'SAA-Q199'

Which security group configuration is **MOST secure** for a **web-tier EC2** and a **private database**?

- Inbound: Allow HTTPS from all; Outbound: Allow port 1433 to database SG
- Inbound to DB: Allow traffic from all on port 1433
- Inbound to DB: Allow HTTPS from Web SG
- Outbound from Web: Allow port 443 to DB

---

## 1. In Simple English

You have two layers:

- A **web EC2 instance** receiving public traffic
- A **private database** not exposed to the internet

You must configure security groups to **securely allow traffic between layers** without unnecessary exposure.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inbound: Allow HTTPS from all; Outbound: Allow port 1433 to database SG** | ✅ Correct   | Web tier accepts HTTPS (443) from users; it can reach DB on 1433 (securely via SG) |
| **Inbound to DB: Allow traffic from all on port 1433**                      | ❌ Incorrect | Too permissive — opens DB to entire internet on a sensitive port                   |
| **Inbound to DB: Allow HTTPS from Web SG**                                  | ❌ Incorrect | Wrong protocol — DB needs 1433 (MSSQL), not HTTPS/443                              |
| **Outbound from Web: Allow port 443 to DB**                                 | ❌ Incorrect | Wrong port — 443 is for HTTPS, not used to access databases                        |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Port 443** is used for **HTTPS web traffic**
- **Port 1433** is used by **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**
- Security Groups are **stateful** — return traffic is allowed if initiated
- Prefer referencing **SGs instead of IPs** when both instances are within VPC
- Do not allow sensitive ports (like 1433) from `0.0.0.0/0` unless absolutely required — always restrict by source SG when possible

## 7. Are the Options Tricky? (Table)

| Option   | Trickiness          | Reason                                              |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Salt     | ⚠️ Yes              | Often used in CM, but not supported by AWS OpsWorks |
| CFEngine | ⚠️ Yes              | Lesser-known tool, might appear plausible           |
| Chef     | ✅ Clear            | Well-documented support via OpsWorks                |
| Puppet   | ✅ Clear            | Supported with AWS-managed control plane            |
| Ansible  | ⚠️ Common Confusion | Very popular tool, but **not managed** via OpsWorks |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

### Strategy:

- ✅ Eliminate tools you **know** are not officially mentioned in AWS documentation
- ✅ Identify **managed integrations** vs **self-managed configurations**
- ✅ Remember AWS services rarely support every tool — know which are **officially supported**

### Tip:

> When AWS supports a tool natively, it often appears in **service names** (e.g., "OpsWorks for Chef", "OpsWorks for Puppet").

- **AWS OpsWorks** is a configuration management service that supports **Chef** and **Puppet** directly.
- These tools help automate the **setup, configuration, and maintenance** of EC2 instances and on-prem resources.
- While **Ansible** and **Salt** are popular open-source tools, **they require custom provisioning** and are not managed by AWS through OpsWorks.
- Chef and Puppet integrations offer **auto-scaling, reporting, and centralized configuration control** within AWS.
