- Focus on **"streaming" vs "messaging"**: Streaming = many consumers; Messaging = one.
- For **real-time ingestion + parallel processing**, choose **Kinesis Data Streams**.
- If question mentions **"delivery to S3 or Redshift"**, then consider **Kinesis Firehose**.
- If the goal is **SQL-based analysis on the stream**, consider **Kinesis Data Analytics**.

### ‚úÖ Tip:

If you see **‚Äúreal-time ingestion + multiple consumers + fault tolerance‚Äù**, default to **Kinesis Data Streams**.

- First, check if the **protocol is UDP or TCP or HTTP**.
- For **custom real-time applications**, **CloudFront is not appropriate** unless it‚Äôs standard HTTP-based media delivery.
- Use **Global Accelerator** when:

  - You need **low latency**
  - The app is **not HTTP-only**
  - The traffic is **global and time-sensitive**

- **NLB** supports UDP, but **Global Accelerator enhances it globally**.

### ‚úÖ Tip:

> If the app is **UDP-based**, **real-time**, and **global**, go with **AWS Global Accelerator**.

| A. NAT gateway supports port forwarding                      | ‚ùå       | NAT Gateway does **not** support port forwarding. It only supports **outbound connections**.                                            |
| B. NAT gateway can be used as a bastion server               | ‚ùå       | NAT Gateway **cannot be used for SSH or RDP**; it only allows **outbound internet access**.                                             |
| C. **Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance** | ‚úÖ       | NAT Instances are **EC2-based**, so **security groups apply**.                                                                          |
| D. Security Groups can be associated with a NAT gateway      | ‚ùå       | NAT Gateways are **not EC2-based**. You **can‚Äôt** assign security groups directly. You control access using **route tables and NACLs**. |
| E. **NAT instance supports port forwarding**                 | ‚úÖ       | You **can configure port forwarding** on a NAT Instance, because it's a standard EC2 instance with custom iptables rules.               |
| F. **NAT instance can be used as a bastion server**          | ‚úÖ       | A NAT instance can be accessed directly via SSH (if allowed), so it **can double as a bastion**‚Äîthough not recommended for production.  |

### 4. ‚úÖ Answer and Explanation

**‚úÖ Correct Answer:**

- **Set up an RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data**

| Option                                   | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ (‚úÖ)**         | ‚úÖ Correct   | Multi-AZ uses **synchronous** replication to a standby in another AZ. Ensures no data loss if the primary fails. |
| **EC2 + MySQL + Lambda + RDS**           | ‚ùå Incorrect | Custom and fragile. Lambda is not meant for real-time DB replication. No built-in sync guarantee.                |
| **RDS + read replica in another AZ**     | ‚ùå Incorrect | Read replicas are **asynchronous** ‚Äî there‚Äôs always lag. Not suitable for minimizing data loss.                  |
| **RDS + read replica in another Region** | ‚ùå Incorrect | Same as above ‚Äî **asynchronous** replication, worse latency, more risk of data loss.                             |

| **S3 + S3 Transfer Acceleration** | ‚úÖ Correct                   | S3 Transfer Acceleration is **ideal for large file uploads/downloads across geographic regions**. It leverages the **CloudFront edge network** for speeding up transfers but specifically optimized for **S3 object transfer**, not just caching. Cost-effective and scalable. |
| **EC2 + Global Accelerator + S3** | ‚ùå Incorrect                 | Global Accelerator improves routing to EC2, **not to S3**. It **cannot accelerate S3 uploads/downloads**, making this suboptimal for large file transfer to S3.                                                                                                                |
| **S3 + CloudFront**               | ‚ö†Ô∏è Plausible but not optimal | CloudFront is excellent for **static content distribution** (e.g., thumbnails, HTML/JS/CSS). But it **does not optimize large file uploads**. It‚Äôs **not designed for accelerating PUT/POST requests to S3**.                                                                  |
| **EC2 + ElastiCache + S3**        | ‚ùå Incorrect                 | ElastiCache helps cache **frequently accessed dynamic data**, not large media files. EC2 adds unnecessary compute when S3 can directly host the application (assuming static or serverless).                                                                                   |

---

## üìä D. Answer and Explanation

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**
**Use SQS long polling to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queues**

| Option                     | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQS long polling**       | ‚úÖ Correct   | Long polling **reduces cost** by avoiding constant empty responses. It waits up to 20 seconds for messages to arrive, minimizing unnecessary API calls compared to short polling. |
| **SQS short polling**      | ‚ùå Incorrect | Short polling **immediately returns** whether or not messages are available, often resulting in more API requests and higher costs.                                               |
| **SQS visibility timeout** | ‚ùå Incorrect | This controls how long a message stays hidden after being retrieved ‚Äî it **does not reduce polling costs**.                                                                       |
| **SQS message timer**      | ‚ùå Incorrect | This delays the availability of a message in the queue, useful for **delayed delivery**, but **irrelevant to cost of retrieval**.                                                 |

## üß† H. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**
Focus on what the **question is really asking** ‚Äî in this case, **cost-efficiency**. Many SQS features are for reliability or timing, but **only long polling affects how often you‚Äôre billed for message requests**.

**Tip:**
Long polling reduces the number of **empty receives**, which directly reduces the number of **billable requests** in SQS.

## üß† H. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Focus on whether the data transfer is **online** (over the network) or **offline** (physically shipped).
- Match transfer tools to **target storage services**. Only DataSync supports **S3, EFS, and FSx-Windows** together for online use.
- Eliminate tools that are **protocol-based gateways** or **narrow in scope**.

**Tip:**
Remember:

- **DataSync** = online, automated, supports S3/EFS/FSx
- **Snowball** = offline, physical migration
- **File Gateway** = hybrid NFS/SMB for S3 only
- **Transfer Family** = SFTP/FTP only for S3

| -------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kinesis Data Streams**   | ‚úÖ Correct   | Offers **ordered, durable, real-time** data streaming with **shard-level sequencing**. Supports **multiple consumers**, such as billing and auditing, reading the same ordered data independently. Retention can be configured up to **7 days or more**. |
| **Kinesis Data Firehose**  | ‚ùå Incorrect | Firehose is for **delivery**, not streaming replay. It **does not preserve order** and doesn‚Äôt allow multiple consumers to process the same events.                                                                                                      |
| **Amazon SQS**             | ‚ùå Incorrect | Standard SQS does **not preserve order**; FIFO SQS does, but is **not suitable for high-throughput streaming data**, and lacks replay beyond 14 days (plus limited consumers).                                                                           |
| **Kinesis Data Analytics** | ‚ùå Incorrect | This is a **stream consumer** (for querying with SQL), not a data storage or streaming system. It **requires** a source like Kinesis Data Streams or Firehose.                                                                                           |

| **Delete the existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue** | ‚úÖ Correct   | You **cannot convert** a Standard queue into FIFO. You must **create a new FIFO queue**, then switch producers/consumers.           |
| **Throughput ‚â§ 3,000 messages/sec**                                    | ‚úÖ Correct   | FIFO queues support up to **3,000 messages/sec** if batching is used, which is applicable here. Without batching, the limit is 300. |
| **Convert existing standard queue to FIFO**                            | ‚ùå Incorrect | No such operation exists. You **must create a new FIFO queue**.                                                                     |
| **Name ends with `.fifo`**                                             | ‚úÖ Correct   | **Required**: FIFO queue names **must** end with `.fifo`.                                                                           |
| **Name must match standard queue**                                     | ‚ùå Incorrect | Name **does not have to match** ‚Äî in fact, this may not even be possible due to the `.fifo` suffix requirement.                     |
| **Throughput ‚â§ 300 messages/sec**                                      | ‚ùå Incorrect | That is the default limit **without batching**. The scenario **mentions batching**, so **3,000 is correct**.                        |

## ‚úÖ E. Final Answer

**‚úîÔ∏è Correct Choices:**

- ‚úÖ Delete the existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue

## üß† H. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Eliminate any options that suggest **converting queue types** ‚Äî not supported
- Remember FIFO queues require a **.fifo suffix**

| ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use AZ ID**           | ‚úÖ Correct   | **AZ names like "us-west-2a" are aliases** that differ by AWS account. To **consistently use the same physical AZ** across accounts, you must refer to the **AZ ID** (e.g., `use2-az1`) which is consistent globally. |
| **Contact AWS Support** | ‚ùå Incorrect | This is not a support issue. It‚Äôs an **expected behavior** by AWS design.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Use default subnet**  | ‚ùå Incorrect | Subnets are tied to **account-specific AZ names**, so they don't solve the problem.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Use default VPC**     | ‚ùå Incorrect | Like subnets, VPCs are also **account-specific**, and **don‚Äôt resolve physical AZ mapping differences**.                                                                                                              |

### 4. Answer and Explanation

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**
**Use delay queues to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds**

| Option                 | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FIFO queues**        | ‚ùå Incorrect | FIFO ensures **order and exactly-once delivery**, but **does not delay** message delivery.                                                   |
| **Visibility timeout** | ‚ùå Incorrect | This prevents other consumers from receiving a message **after it's already delivered**, not before initial delivery.                        |
| **Delay queues**       | ‚úÖ Correct   | **Delay queues delay the delivery** of messages to consumers by a specified number of seconds (up to 15 minutes). Perfect for this use case. |
| **Dead-letter queues** | ‚ùå Incorrect | DLQs are for **capturing failed or undelivered messages**, not for delaying message delivery.                                                |

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Visibility Timeout | Often confused with delivery delay, but applies **after delivery** |
| Dead-Letter Queue  | Might seem related, but it's for **failure handling**, not timing  |
| FIFO Queue         | Relevant for **ordering**, not timing of delivery                  |
| Delay Queue        | ‚úÖ Only correct option for **pre-delivery postponement**           |

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- If the delay must happen **before message delivery**, use **delay queues**
- If the delay must happen **after delivery** (to delay retries), use **visibility timeout**

**Tip:**
Default delay for a queue can be set, or **per-message delay** can be configured via `DelaySeconds`.

### 4. Answer and Explanation

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**
**Launch AWS Global Accelerator and create endpoints for all the Regions. Register the ALBs of each Region to the corresponding endpoints**

| **Global Accelerator + ALBs per Region**    | ‚úÖ Correct   | AWS Global Accelerator provides **2 static IP addresses** that front your **global ALBs**. It **routes traffic intelligently** to the closest healthy endpoint, and greatly reduces **firewall IP complexity**. Ideal for simplifying multi-Region architectures. |
| **NLB with ALB private IPs as targets**     | ‚ùå Incorrect | ALBs **do not expose private IPs**, and you **cannot register an ALB as a target** of an NLB.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Configure Elastic IPs for each ALB**      | ‚ùå Incorrect | ALBs are **managed services** and do **not support Elastic IP addresses** ‚Äî only **NLBs can**.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Assign Elastic IP to Auto Scaling Group** | ‚ùå Incorrect | You **can‚Äôt directly assign EIPs to ASGs** ‚Äî EIPs are attached to **individual EC2 instances** or **NAT gateways**, not ASGs as a whole. Doesn‚Äôt solve the ALB IP sprawl problem either.                                                                          |

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

## ‚úÖ Strategy:

- Remember that **SCPs are filters, not grants**‚Äîthey limit what IAM can allow.
- Always verify **who is affected**‚Äîincluding root, service-linked roles, etc.
- Think **boundary first**: If SCP denies something, _nobody_ can do it‚Äîeven if IAM says yes.

## üí° Tip:

If you're ever unsure, ask yourself: _‚ÄúIs this about what‚Äôs allowed (IAM) or what‚Äôs possible (SCP boundary)?‚Äù_

| Spot blocks (now deprecated)       | Understanding their behavior and interruptibility                           |

---

### üìä 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answers:

- If a spot request is persistent, then it is opened again after your Spot Instance is interrupted
- When you cancel an active spot request, it **does not** terminate the associated instance
- **Spot blocks are designed not to be interrupted** (Note: this is deprecated, but was correct at the time of publication)

| Option                                                                                           | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| If a spot request is persistent, then it is opened again after your Spot Instance is interrupted | ‚úÖ Correct   | A persistent request remains open and attempts to launch a new instance after the current one is interrupted                            |
| When you cancel an active spot request, it does not terminate the associated instance            | ‚úÖ Correct   | Canceling the request only prevents future spot instances from launching‚Äîit does not terminate existing ones                            |
| Spot blocks are designed not to be interrupted                                                   | ‚úÖ Correct   | Spot blocks (also called ‚Äúdefined duration‚Äù instances) were designed to not be interrupted during the specified duration (1 to 6 hours) |
| If a spot request is persistent, then it is opened again after you stop the Spot Instance        | ‚ùå Incorrect | Stopping a spot instance doesn‚Äôt reopen the request‚Äîpersistent behavior is tied to interruption, not manual stop                        |
| When you cancel an active spot request, it terminates the associated instance as well            | ‚ùå Incorrect | Cancellation prevents new requests but does **not** terminate the current instance                                                      |
| Spot blocks are designed to be interrupted, just like a spot instance                            | ‚ùå Incorrect | This is misleading‚ÄîSpot blocks were _specifically designed_ to avoid interruptions during their scheduled duration                      |

---

### üü© 5. Final Answer

‚úÖ Correct Choices:

- **If a spot request is persistent, then it is opened again after your Spot Instance is interrupted**
- **When you cancel an active spot request, it does not terminate the associated instance**
- **Spot blocks are designed not to be interrupted**

---

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

## ‚úÖ Strategy:

- Remember to **separate request behavior from instance lifecycle**‚Äîcanceling a request ‚â† stopping the instance.
- Understand **persistent vs one-time** request logic.
- Always check AWS updates‚Äîfeatures like Spot Blocks are deprecated, but may still appear in legacy questions.

## üí° Tip:

When studying Spot, anchor your understanding around **what causes a request to reopen** (interrupt), and **what doesn‚Äôt** (manual stop, cancellation).

---

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

## ‚úÖ Strategy:

- Determine whether the instance has a **public IP**. If it does, the **Internet Gateway** does the NAT.
- Use **NAT instances/gateways** only for **private subnets** with no public IPs that need to access the internet.
- Focus on **who changes the IP address** during communication‚Äîonly a few AWS services do that.

## üí° Tip:

If an instance has a **public IP and route to the IGW**, **you do not need a NAT**‚Äîthe Internet Gateway handles the translation.

### üìä 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:

- **Use AWS Volume Gateway - Cached Volume - to store the most frequently accessed logs locally for low-latency access while storing the full volume with all logs in its Amazon S3 service bucket**

| Option                                 | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AWS Volume Gateway - Cached Volume** | ‚úÖ Correct   | Cached Volumes store **frequently accessed data locally**, while **backing up the full volume in S3**‚Äîideal for this hybrid cloud use case       |
| AWS Volume Gateway - Stored Volume     | ‚ùå Incorrect | Stored Volumes do the opposite‚Äî**store full data locally** and asynchronously back up to S3. Not optimal if you want cloud primary + local cache |
| AWS Direct Connect                     | ‚ùå Incorrect | Direct Connect is a **network link**, not a storage solution. It does not provide caching or automatic tiering                                   |
| AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized    | ‚ùå Incorrect | Snowball is for **bulk transfer** and temporary edge storage‚Äînot suited for continuous caching or hybrid cloud integration                       |

| Route53 Multi Value record                       | ‚ùå Incorrect | Multi Value routing can **distribute traffic**, but it doesn‚Äôt **scale infrastructure** or handle compute load increases                      |
| CloudFront distribution in front of your website | ‚ùå Incorrect | CloudFront is great for **static or cacheable content**. Since the content is **highly dynamic**, CloudFront provides **little benefit** here |
| Deploy the website on S3                         | ‚ùå Incorrect | S3 is suitable for **static websites**, but the question clearly states that content is **dynamic**, so this is not applicable                |
| **Use an Auto Scaling Group**                    | ‚úÖ Correct   | Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) automatically **scale EC2 instances** based on demand, perfect for handling unpredictable or 10x surges in traffic  |

| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It configures a security group's outbound rules                | ‚ùå Incorrect | The snippet uses `SecurityGroupIngress`, which defines **inbound**, not outbound rules                            |
| It prevents traffic from reaching HTTP unless from 192.168.1.1 | ‚ùå Incorrect | Actually, it allows **all IPs (0.0.0.0/0)** to reach HTTP (port 80). It **does not restrict** HTTP to 192.168.1.1 |
| It configures an NACL's inbound rules                          | ‚ùå Incorrect | This is a **security group rule**, not a Network ACL rule. NACLs are configured separately                        |
| It only allows the IP 0.0.0.0 to reach HTTP                    | ‚ùå Incorrect | 0.0.0.0/0 means **any IP address** globally‚Äînot just 0.0.0.0                                                      |
| **It configures a security group's inbound rules**             | ‚úÖ Correct   | `SecurityGroupIngress` explicitly defines **inbound rules** in CloudFormation                                     |
| **It lets traffic flow from one IP on port 22**                | ‚úÖ Correct   | The second rule allows TCP traffic from `192.168.1.1/32` to port 22 (typically SSH)                               |
| **It allows any IP to pass through on the HTTP port**          | ‚úÖ Correct   | The first rule allows inbound TCP on port 80 (HTTP) from `0.0.0.0/0`, meaning **all public IPs**                  |

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

## ‚úÖ Strategy:

- Look at the **resource type keyword**:

  - `SecurityGroupIngress` ‚Üí **inbound rules**
  - `SecurityGroupEgress` ‚Üí **outbound rules**

- Understand **CIDR notation** (`0.0.0.0/0` = open to the world, `x.x.x.x/32` = one IP)
- Eliminate options related to **NACL** if the keyword is clearly **Security Group**

## üí° Tip:

**Security groups are stateful**, and rules apply per-direction. Always check if you're adding ingress (inbound) or egress (outbound).

Here is the **full SAA-C03 analysis** for the tape backup migration to AWS Cloud scenario, using your structured 10-section format:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. In Simple English

A company stores **petabytes of backup data on physical tapes** and wants to move this to AWS. But they **don‚Äôt want to change their existing tape-based backup workflows**. The CTO also wants the solution to be **cost-effective**. You‚Äôre asked to recommend the **best solution** that keeps current workflows intact **and reduces storage cost**.

<h5>Question 'SAA-Q295'</h5>

Here is the **full SAA-C03 analysis** for the Route 53 and Network Load Balancer (NLB) traffic distribution scenario using your structured 10-section format:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. In Simple English

You have two **Network Load Balancers** (NLBs), each in a separate **Availability Zone** (AZ-A and AZ-B), and Route 53 is configured to route traffic to both. Cross-zone load balancing is **disabled**, and each AZ has a different number of registered targets:

- AZ-A: 4 targets
- AZ-B: 6 targets

You're asked how traffic is distributed **from Route 53 to the EC2 targets** under these conditions.

| Traffic percentage math       | Knowing how to calculate **even split per AZ**, and then within each target group          |

---

### üìä 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:

- **Each of the four targets in AZ-A receives 12.5% of the traffic**

---

### üîç Step-by-step Explanation:

- Route 53 splits traffic **evenly** between the two NLB nodes (one in each AZ) because **no weighting is mentioned**.

  ‚úÖ So each NLB receives **50% of the total traffic**.

- **Cross-zone load balancing is disabled**, so each NLB only sends traffic to **its local targets**.

- **AZ-A has 4 targets**, so its 50% of traffic is divided equally among 4:

  $$
  \frac{50\%}{4} = 12.5\% \text{ per target}
  $$

- **AZ-B has 6 targets**, so its 50% is divided among 6:

  $$
  \frac{50\%}{6} \approx 8.33\% \text{ per target}
  $$

---

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

## ‚úÖ Strategy:

- First, determine if **cross-zone load balancing is on or off**
- Then, assume **even 50/50 split** from Route 53 to each NLB unless otherwise weighted
- Divide each NLB‚Äôs 50% among its own **local targets only**

## üí° Tip:

**Cross-zone load balancing ON** = targets share **across all AZs**
**Cross-zone OFF** = targets only serve traffic from their own AZ‚Äôs NLB

### üìä 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:

- **The instance with the oldest launch configuration will be terminated in AZ-B**

---

### üîç Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **AZ-B has more instances (4)** than AZ-A (3)

   - So ASG will try to **balance** AZs first during scale-in.
   - ‚úÖ ASG **will choose AZ-B** to terminate an instance from.

2. Then, within AZ-B, ASG applies the **termination policy**:

   - Default termination policy is:

     1. **Oldest launch configuration**
     2. If tie: **Oldest launch template**
     3. Then: **Oldest instance**
     4. Then: Random

‚úÖ So, the **instance with the oldest launch configuration** **in AZ-B** will be selected for termination.

## ‚úÖ Strategy:

- Ask: Is this **scale-in** or **scale-out**?
- During **scale-in**, ASG:

  1. Chooses **AZ with most instances**
  2. Terminates based on **termination policy** (default: oldest launch config)

## üí° Tip:

Unless explicitly overridden, ASG termination always tries to:

1. Keep AZs balanced
2. Remove oldest (not random) instances

### üìä 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:

- **Convert the Amazon EC2 instance EBS volume to gp2**

### üß† Breakdown:

- `io1` (Provisioned IOPS SSD) is **very expensive** and typically used for **mission-critical workloads** with **consistent high IOPS requirements**.
- `gp2` (General Purpose SSD) is **much cheaper** and can handle **bursty workloads**, thanks to its **credit-based burst model**.
- Since the volume is mostly **underutilized** with only **occasional I/O bursts**, gp2 is a **better fit** and significantly **cheaper**.

<h5>Question 'SAA-Q299'</h5>

Here is the **full SAA-C03 analysis** for the IP whitelisting and high availability architecture scenario, using your structured 10-section format:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. In Simple English

You‚Äôre designing a solution for a **bank customer**. The customer has a **strict requirement**: they must **whitelist only up to two public IP addresses** when their systems access the internet. Your system needs to:

- Support **high availability**
- **Scale up** to 10 instances (so Auto Scaling Group is necessary)
- **Maintain no more than 2 public IPs** for **egress (outgoing) traffic**

You're asked to pick the best **load balancer + ASG setup** that meets these **IP control and scalability** needs.

---

### üìä 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:

- **Use a Network Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

---

### üß† Why?

- The requirement is to **whitelist up to 2 IPs** for **egress traffic** (outbound from app to external services).
- The **only way to guarantee fixed public IPs** in AWS for outbound traffic is to **use NAT Gateway or NAT Instances** **behind Elastic IPs**.
- However, **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** can also be associated with **Elastic IP addresses**, which **solves this exact problem**.

üü¢ NLB:

- Supports **static Elastic IPs**
- Can be fronted with a **fixed IP** that the bank can whitelist
- Supports **high-throughput**, **Layer 4** load balancing
- Works well with **Auto Scaling Groups**

| Option      | Trickiness? | Why It‚Äôs Tricky                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| S3 Hosting  | ‚úÖ Yes      | Sounds like a fix, but doesn‚Äôt address **global latency** or EC2 offload alone |
| ELB caching | ‚úÖ Yes      | Misleading ‚Äì ELBs don‚Äôt provide content caching                                |
| EC2 Upgrade | ‚úÖ Yes      | Easy assumption, but adds cost without solving the root issue                  |

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

## ‚úÖ Strategy:

- For **global file delivery**, think **CloudFront**
- If the app is **static or download-heavy**, avoid compute-heavy paths (like EC2)
- Always match **content type** (large files) with **distribution service** (CDN)

## üí° Tip:

CloudFront works **seamlessly with S3 or custom origins** and is optimized for **large, cacheable files** like images or video packs.
