## Question 'SAA-Q001'

A solutions architect needs to backup some application log files from an online ecommerce store to Amazon S3. It is unknown how often the logs will be accessed or which logs will be accessed the most. The solutions architect must keep costs as low as possible by using the appropriate S3 storage class.

**Which S3 storage class should be implemented to meet these requirements?**

- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- S3 Glacier
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

---

## 1. In Simple English

The architect needs to store log files in S3. Since it’s unclear which logs will be accessed or how often, the chosen S3 storage class must automatically adjust to access patterns to keep costs low without requiring manual oversight.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**                         | ✅ Correct   | Designed for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It automatically moves data between frequent and infrequent tiers based on access, minimizing cost without requiring manual lifecycle policies. |
| **S3 Glacier**                                     | ❌ Incorrect | Intended for long-term archival. Retrieval is slow and expensive, making it unsuitable for data that might need unpredictable or real-time access.                                                          |
| **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)** | ❌ Incorrect | Cheaper than Standard-IA but stores data in a single Availability Zone, which reduces durability. It's also meant for known infrequently accessed data.                                                     |
| **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)** | ❌ Incorrect | Good for known infrequent access patterns, but not for unpredictable usage. Retrieval costs may rise if logs are accessed more than expected.                                                               |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: If a question says the data access frequency is _unknown_ or _may vary_, eliminate fixed-access options like Glacier and IA. Instead, look for classes with **automated tiering** like S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

**Tip**: Think in terms of operational effort — Intelligent-Tiering requires no manual lifecycle management and provides optimal cost control when access patterns are unpredictable.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is purpose-built for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It automatically monitors object access and moves data between access tiers without any manual intervention or lifecycle rules.

It has no retrieval fees when objects remain in either the frequent or infrequent tier, making it highly cost-efficient even if access patterns fluctuate.

Intelligent-Tiering is the only S3 storage class that adapts automatically, which reduces the risk of human error or misjudging access frequency.

It also allows you to opt in to archival access tiers (Archive Access and Deep Archive Access), further reducing storage costs for objects that become cold over time.

This class is ideal for application logs, user-uploaded content, and other datasets where you can’t predict how often individual objects will be read — giving you the balance of performance and savings with minimal operational overhead.

In contrast, IA classes penalize you if your assumptions are wrong, and Glacier requires thoughtful planning around retention and retrieval timing.

For cost-conscious architectures with uncertain patterns, S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a “set it and forget it” solution that aligns perfectly with AWS Well-Architected Framework’s cost optimization pillar.

## Question 'SAA-Q002'

A retail company with many stores and warehouses is implementing IoT sensors to gather monitoring data from devices in each location. The data will be sent to AWS in real time. A solutions architect must provide a solution for ensuring events are received in order for each device and ensure that data is saved for future processing.

**Which solution would be MOST efficient?**

- Use an Amazon SQS standard queue for real-time events with one queue for each device. Trigger an AWS Lambda function from the SQS queue to save data to Amazon S3
- Use an Amazon SQS FIFO queue for real-time events with one queue for each device. Trigger an AWS Lambda function for the SQS queue to save data to Amazon EFS
- Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time events with a partition key for each device. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to save data to Amazon S3
- Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time events with a shard for each device. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to save data to Amazon EBS

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to collect IoT data from devices in real time. The data for each device must arrive in the exact order it was sent. The solution should be efficient and store the data for later use.

| **Use an Amazon SQS standard queue for real-time events with one queue for each device. Trigger an AWS Lambda function from the SQS queue to save data to Amazon S3** | ❌ Incorrect | SQS standard queues do not guarantee ordering. Even with separate queues, this introduces complexity and is not the most efficient solution for real-time streaming.                |
| **Use an Amazon SQS FIFO queue for real-time events with one queue for each device. Trigger an AWS Lambda function for the SQS queue to save data to Amazon EFS**     | ❌ Incorrect | FIFO queues do guarantee order, but managing one per device doesn't scale well. Also, Amazon EFS is not ideal for event stream data compared to S3.                                 |
| **Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time events with a partition key for each device. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to save data to Amazon S3**             | ✅ Correct   | Partition keys in Kinesis ensure ordering per device. Kinesis Firehose efficiently batches and writes data to S3. This is scalable, efficient, and purpose-built for this use case. |
| **Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time events with a shard for each device. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to save data to Amazon EBS**                    | ❌ Incorrect | You don’t create one shard per device — you use partition keys. Also, EBS is block storage, not designed for ingesting and storing streaming data.                                  |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Focus on three dimensions — _ordering guarantees_, _scalability_, and _appropriate data sinks_. Kinesis + partition key ensures ordered events per device without exploding your architecture.

**Tip**: When ordering matters per device or user, use partition keys. Avoid per-device FIFO queues unless the number of devices is extremely limited — it's not scalable.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** provides **per-partition key ordering**, which makes it ideal for scenarios like IoT, where each device sends a stream of data that must be preserved in order.
- **Partition keys** allow devices to share shards while still maintaining order per device — much more scalable than dedicating a shard per device.
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** simplifies stream-to-storage by buffering, batching, and writing data automatically to S3, Redshift, or other services — it removes the need to manage consumers manually.
- Avoid **EBS and EFS** as final destinations for streaming data unless you have a very specific requirement for a file or block interface — they are not optimized for ingestion pipelines.
- **SQS FIFO queues** do maintain order but managing thousands of them (one per device) can become complex and expensive, and lacks the throughput and parallelism of Kinesis-based designs.

## Question 'SAA-Q003'

Amazon EC2 instances in a development environment run between 9am and 5pm Monday–Friday. Production instances run 24/7.  
**Which pricing models should be used to optimize cost and ensure capacity is available?**  
_(Select TWO.)_

- Use Reserved instances for the production environment
- Use On-Demand instances for the production environment
- Use Spot instances for the development environment
- Use Reserved instances for the development environment
- On-demand capacity reservations for the development environment

---

## 1. In Simple English

The production servers are always on, so their pricing model should reduce cost while securing availability. The development servers run only during weekday business hours, so the goal is to optimize cost while ensuring capacity when needed — without overpaying during off-hours.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Reserved instances for the production environment**           | ✅ Correct   | Production is always running and needs guaranteed capacity. Standard or Convertible RIs offer long-term cost savings (up to 72%) and capacity assurance.       |
| **Use On-Demand instances for the production environment**          | ❌ Incorrect | Works but costs significantly more than RIs for long-term workloads — no added benefit.                                                                        |
| **Use Spot instances for the development environment**              | ❌ Incorrect | Cheaper, but risk of interruption may disrupt dev workflows and reduce productivity. Not ideal for environments needing session persistence.                   |
| **Use Reserved instances for the development environment**          | ❌ Incorrect | Reserved capacity would be underutilized (only 24% weekly usage), resulting in wasted cost.                                                                    |
| **On-demand capacity reservations for the development environment** | ✅ Correct   | Provides guaranteed capacity during specific hours with no long-term commitment. Allows termination when not needed, matching part-time schedules efficiently. |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: First categorize workloads: _always-on_ (production) vs _variable/short-lived_ (development). Then:

- Use **Reserved Instances** for 24/7 workloads to lock in savings and guarantee capacity.
- Use **On-Demand Capacity Reservations** when you need flexible capacity during predictable windows (like dev hours), without upfront cost or risk of interruption.

**Tip**: Spot saves money but is only appropriate when interruptions are acceptable. For dev sessions where stability matters, capacity reservations hit the sweet spot.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Reserved Instances** offer deep cost savings for long-term, stable usage like production systems. Standard RIs lock you into instance type and region but offer the greatest savings. Convertible RIs allow flexibility at slightly lower discounts.
- **On-Demand Capacity Reservations** are often misunderstood — they let you guarantee EC2 capacity **without any upfront payment or long-term contract**. This is perfect for **short-term, predictable needs**, like development environments that run 9-to-5. You’re only billed for the capacity while it’s running, and you don’t risk resource unavailability.
- **Spot Instances** sound ideal for dev/test use cases, but **session-sensitive environments** may not tolerate 2-minute termination notices — especially where devs lose unsaved progress or pipelines must be restarted manually.
- Using **Reserved Instances for part-time workloads** is cost-inefficient: you'd be paying for 168 hours/week but using only 40 — a >75% waste.
- **Combining pricing models** is often the real-world solution. For example: Reserved Instances for always-on systems + Spot for non-critical CI pipelines + Capacity Reservations for human-in-the-loop dev systems.
- AWS also offers **Savings Plans**, which provide similar discounts to RIs but with more flexibility — an alternative worth exploring for mixed environments.

## Question 'SAA-Q004'

A financial services company has a web application with an application tier running in the U.S and Europe. The database tier consists of a MySQL database running on Amazon EC2 in `us-west-1`. Users are directed to the closest application tier using Route 53 latency-based routing. The users in Europe have reported poor performance when running queries.

**Which changes should a Solutions Architect make to the database tier to improve performance?**

- Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora global database in MySQL compatibility mode. Configure the application tier in Europe to use the local reader endpoint
- Migrate the database to Amazon RedShift. Use AWS DMS to synchronize data. Configure applications to use the RedShift data warehouse for queries
- Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. Configure Multi-AZ in one of the European Regions
- Create an Amazon RDS Read Replica in one of the European regions. Configure the application tier in Europe to use the read replica for queries

---

## 1. In Simple English

The application runs in both the U.S. and Europe, but the database is only in the U.S., causing slow query responses for European users. The architect needs to reduce database query latency for those users.

| **Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora global database in MySQL compatibility mode. Configure the application tier in Europe to use the local reader endpoint** | ✅ Correct   | Aurora Global Database replicates data across AWS regions with sub-second latency. This lets the EU app tier read from a local, low-latency replica.          |
| **Migrate the database to Amazon RedShift. Use AWS DMS to synchronize data. Configure applications to use the RedShift data warehouse for queries**                 | ❌ Incorrect | RedShift is a data warehouse, not suited for transactional query workloads. This is a mismatch for typical application queries.                               |
| **Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. Configure Multi-AZ in one of the European Regions**                                                                 | ❌ Incorrect | Multi-AZ provides high availability within a single region, not low-latency access across continents. It also doesn’t provide cross-region reads.             |
| **Create an Amazon RDS Read Replica in one of the European regions. Configure the application tier in Europe to use the read replica for queries**                  | ❌ Incorrect | While promising, cross-region RDS read replicas can have higher replication lag than Aurora Global DB and don't support as fast failover or read scalability. |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Focus on three elements — where users are located, where data is stored, and whether reads or writes are latency-sensitive. If users span multiple continents and reads dominate, **Aurora Global Database** is the top-tier option.

**Tip**: Always match service tier to latency and scale. Aurora Global = subsecond multi-region reads. RDS Read Replica = eventual consistency, higher lag, and less efficient global access.

| Cross-region reads with some lag  | RDS Read Replica |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon Aurora Global Database** is designed for **globally distributed applications** with a single writable region and **read replicas in up to five additional regions**, supporting **millisecond-level replication lag**. This makes it ideal for reducing cross-region read latency, like in this scenario where European users experience slow reads from a U.S. database.
- **Reader endpoints** in remote regions allow the application to connect to a local read-only replica, drastically reducing latency without requiring full database re-architecture.
- While **RDS MySQL Read Replicas** do support cross-region deployment, they suffer from **higher replication lag**, and lack the performance and automatic failover capabilities that Aurora offers. They're more suited to bursty or analytical read loads that tolerate staleness.
- **RDS Multi-AZ** is for availability within one region. It provides failover protection but doesn't help with global read latency — all reads still go to the region where the primary resides.
- **Amazon RedShift** is a **data warehouse**, not a transactional database. While you can use AWS DMS to migrate relational data into it, it's **not suitable** for real-time queries from a web application that expects transactional consistency and low latency.
- In high-performance global apps, **choosing Aurora Global Database not only improves read performance but simplifies operational management**, reducing the need for complex multi-region replication setups and manual failover design.

## Question 'SAA-Q005'

A company is deploying a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances running Linux across multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region. The application requires a data storage solution that can be accessed by all of the EC2 instances simultaneously. The solution must be highly scalable and easy to implement. The storage must be mounted using the NFS protocol.

**Which solution meets these requirements?**

- Create an Amazon EBS volume and use EBS Multi-Attach to mount the volume to all EC2 instances across each Availability Zone
- Create an Amazon RDS database and store the data in a BLOB format. Point the application instances to the RDS endpoint
- Create an Amazon EFS file system with mount targets in each Availability Zone. Configure the application instances to mount the file system
- Create an Amazon S3 bucket and create an S3 gateway endpoint to allow access to the file system using the NFS protocol

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Focus on technical constraints like “must use NFS,” “mountable,” and “multi-AZ access.” Immediately eliminate object stores (S3) and database backends (RDS) for file system needs.

**Tip**: When a question mentions **shared file access** with NFS semantics, Amazon EFS is almost always the right fit. Watch out for EBS Multi-Attach being misapplied across AZs — it's restricted.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon EFS** (Elastic File System) is a **fully managed, scalable, POSIX-compliant file system** that can be mounted by **multiple EC2 instances across AZs**, making it ideal for shared workloads.
- It supports the **NFSv4 protocol**, which allows Linux-based instances to mount and access the file system just like a traditional network share.
- **Mount targets** are automatically created in each AZ when you configure EFS, allowing EC2 instances in different AZs to access EFS over the lowest-latency path.
- **EBS Multi-Attach** supports simultaneous attachment to multiple EC2 instances, but **only within the same Availability Zone**, and only with certain file systems (like clustered FSes). It also lacks horizontal scalability.
- **Amazon S3** is a powerful object store, but it is not mountable using NFS and doesn’t provide file system semantics (e.g., permissions, locking, directory hierarchy).
- **Amazon RDS** is a managed relational database — it’s built for SQL queries and structured data, not for shared file storage or mounting via file system protocols.
- For workloads like content management, web hosting, analytics staging, and shared application data directories, **EFS provides the easiest and most scalable NFS-based shared storage solution** in AWS.

## Question 'SAA-Q006'

A company provides a REST-based interface to an application that allows a partner company to send data in near-real time. The application then processes the data that is received and stores it for later analysis. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances. The partner company has received many 503 Service Unavailable Errors when sending data to the application and the compute capacity reaches its limits and is unable to process requests when spikes in data volume occur.

**Which design should a Solutions Architect implement to improve scalability?**

- Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest the data. Process the data using AWS Lambda functions
- Use Amazon API Gateway in front of the existing application. Create a usage plan with a quota limit for the partner company
- Use Amazon SNS to ingest the data and trigger AWS Lambda functions to process the data in near-real time
- Use Amazon SQS to ingest the data. Configure the EC2 instances to process messages from the SQS queue

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app is overwhelmed during traffic spikes, causing failures (503 errors). We need to fix this by **decoupling the ingestion from processing**, and letting the backend scale more efficiently and absorb bursts without dropping requests.

| **Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest the data. Process the data using AWS Lambda functions**                             | ✅ Correct   | Kinesis buffers and scales automatically, decoupling ingestion from processing. Lambda scales with data flow and can handle bursts, preventing 503 errors. Ideal for near-real-time streaming. |
| **Use Amazon API Gateway in front of the existing application. Create a usage plan with a quota limit for the partner company** | ❌ Incorrect | Throttling may reduce 503s, but it limits valid data instead of solving the scalability issue. This is a control, not a processing solution.                                                   |
| **Use Amazon SNS to ingest the data and trigger AWS Lambda functions to process the data in near-real time**                    | ❌ Incorrect | SNS is a pub/sub service, not ideal for ordered, high-volume ingestion. No durable buffering or replay like Kinesis provides.                                                                  |
| **Use Amazon SQS to ingest the data. Configure the EC2 instances to process messages from the SQS queue**                       | ❌ Incorrect | SQS is better for decoupling, but processing by EC2 doesn’t solve the scaling problem — the original bottleneck remains unless EC2 autoscaling is robust.                                      |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Look for symptoms of overwhelmed applications — 503 errors, latency, crashing instances. Then ask:

- Can we buffer the input?
- Can we autoscale the backend?

If the workload involves streams, high velocity, or real-time data: Kinesis is often best.

**Tip**: Kinesis is built for **ordered, high-volume, burstable ingestion**. Pair it with Lambda to offload compute, process in parallel, and remove direct pressure from EC2.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** is designed for high-throughput, low-latency data ingestion and near-real-time processing. It supports **partition keys** to maintain per-source order and provides **durable storage for up to 7 days**, allowing consumers (like Lambda) to retry or replay events if needed.
- **AWS Lambda** can scale horizontally with the number of shards, making it well-suited for processing spiky incoming streams without pre-provisioned compute.
- **Using Kinesis + Lambda** removes the direct pressure from EC2, eliminates 503 errors caused by resource exhaustion, and ensures resilience against traffic bursts.
- **Amazon SNS** is designed for fan-out pub/sub messaging but lacks persistence, ordering, or replay, making it suboptimal for ingestion pipelines that require durability.
- **Amazon SQS** is an excellent decoupling tool but pairing it with EC2 doesn’t solve the scaling bottleneck unless EC2 itself is autoscaled and stateless.
- **API Gateway quotas and throttling** may reduce errors but are reactive — they don’t increase scalability. They simply delay or reject excess requests, which may not be acceptable for partner integrations.
- For architectures that must **absorb, scale, and reliably process large event flows**, **Kinesis + Lambda is a modern serverless and event-driven best practice**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)** is designed specifically for **HPC applications** that require **low-latency, high-throughput, tightly-coupled node communication** — such as fluid dynamics simulations, seismic analysis, or financial modeling.
- EFA supports **OS bypass**, allowing network traffic to avoid the operating system kernel, significantly reducing latency and jitter — a key requirement in many HPC and MPI (Message Passing Interface) workloads.
- **EFA integrates with MPI libraries**, commonly used in legacy HPC applications that depend on shared memory and fast inter-process communication.
- While **ENA** supports very high bandwidth (up to 100 Gbps), it does **not support MPI or OS bypass**, making it insufficient for HPC workloads.
- **ENI** is simply a logical network interface — not a hardware adapter — and is useful for attaching multiple IPs or managing security groups but not for performance-critical networking.
- Finally, **Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)** have no role in inter-node communication — they provide persistent public IPv4 addresses and are irrelevant to HPC networking requirements.
- AWS HPC architectures often combine **EFA with placement groups** and **EC2 compute-optimized instances** (e.g., `c5n.18xlarge`, `p4d.24xlarge`) to form tightly-coupled clusters with low network latency and high throughput.

## Question 'SAA-Q008'

A company has deployed a new website on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Amazon Route 53 is used for the DNS service. The company has asked a Solutions Architect to create a backup website with support contact details that users will be directed to automatically if the primary website is down.

**How should the Solutions Architect deploy this solution cost-effectively?**

- Configure a static website using Amazon S3 and create a Route 53 weighted routing policy
- Deploy the backup website on EC2 and ALB in another Region and use Route 53 health checks for failover routing
- Configure a static website using Amazon S3 and create a Route 53 failover routing policy
- Create the backup website on EC2 and ALB in another Region and create an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to build a **low-cost backup site** that users will be sent to **only when the main site is down**. The solution must be automatic and affordable — no need to run a second full website unless the primary one fails.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Look for **"low-cost + failover"**. If the backup is only for emergencies and doesn’t need compute power, **S3 static site hosting** is ideal. Then choose **failover routing** in Route 53, not weighted or latency-based.

**Tip**: Weighted routing splits traffic. Failover routing **redirects only when a health check fails** — ideal for primary-backup setups.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon S3** can serve static websites from a bucket with public access and an index document. This makes it ideal for backup pages like contact details or service status.
- **Route 53 failover routing** uses **health checks** to monitor the primary resource (e.g., ALB or EC2 endpoint). If the health check fails, traffic is automatically routed to the backup target — in this case, an S3 static website.
- This pattern is highly **cost-effective** because the S3 bucket incurs almost no ongoing compute cost. It only serves traffic when the main site is down.
- **Weighted routing** is used to split traffic deliberately — it does not offer failover.
- **Global Accelerator** routes users to the closest healthy application endpoint via the AWS edge network. It is excellent for **active-active high availability**, not passive failover to a static page.
- For scenarios where the backup website simply displays static info (e.g., "We're down. Here's how to contact us."), **S3 + failover routing is the perfect architectural fit**.

## Question 'SAA-Q009'

A company runs an application that uses an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database. The database is currently not encrypted. A Solutions Architect has been instructed that due to new compliance requirements all existing and new data in the database must be encrypted. The database experiences high volumes of changes and no data can be lost.

**How can the Solutions Architect enable encryption for the database without incurring any data loss?**

- Update the RDS DB to Multi-AZ mode and enable encryption for the standby replica. Perform a failover to the standby instance and then delete the unencrypted RDS DB instance
- Create an RDS read replica and specify an encryption key. Promote the encrypted read replica to primary. Update the application to point to the new RDS DB endpoint
- Create a snapshot of the existing RDS DB instance. Create an encrypted copy of the snapshot. Create a new RDS DB instance from the encrypted snapshot and update the application. Use AWS DMS to synchronize data between the source and destination RDS DBs
- Create a snapshot of the existing RDS DB instance. Create an encrypted copy of the snapshot. Create a new RDS DB instance from the encrypted snapshot. Configure the application to use the new DB endpoint

---

## 1. In Simple English

The database is not encrypted but must be now due to compliance requirements. You can’t lose any data and the application continues to update the database frequently. The goal is to apply encryption without downtime or risk of data loss.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Whenever you see **“enable encryption on existing RDS”**, remember:

- You cannot encrypt in-place.
- You must create an **encrypted snapshot**.
- Live replication tools (like DMS) are essential when **data loss is unacceptable**.

**Tip**: If the database is active and changes often, only DMS can safely replicate changes between unencrypted and encrypted DBs before the final cutover.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon RDS does not support enabling encryption on an existing database instance** — encryption must be specified **at creation time**.
- To encrypt a previously unencrypted RDS database:
  1. Take a manual **snapshot** of the existing DB.
  2. Create an **encrypted copy** of that snapshot using a KMS key.
  3. Launch a **new encrypted RDS instance** from the encrypted snapshot.
- However, this creates a **static copy** of the DB. If the original is actively receiving changes, those changes will be missing unless you use **AWS DMS** to replicate live updates from the source DB to the new encrypted DB.
- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** can replicate data continuously and capture ongoing changes until you're ready to cut over the application to the new encrypted database, ensuring **zero data loss**.
- Simply switching to an instance launched from the encrypted snapshot without DMS could result in **lost transactions**, especially under high write conditions — which violates the compliance requirement.
- Other methods like Multi-AZ, read replicas, or EIPs are not relevant in this context because **encryption cannot be added retroactively to a running RDS instance** or its read replicas.

## Question 'SAA-Q010'

A company runs containerized applications for many application workloads in an on-premise data center. The company is planning to deploy containers to AWS and the chief architect has mandated that the same configuration and administrative tools must be used across all containerized environments. The company also wishes to remain cloud agnostic to safeguard against the impact of future changes in cloud strategy.

**How can a Solutions Architect design a managed solution that will align with open-source software?**

- Launch the containers on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances in a cluster placement group
- Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Amazon EC2 instance worker nodes
- Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with AWS Fargate instances
- Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and EKS worker nodes

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to move their containers to AWS but still use the **same open-source tools** (like Kubernetes or Helm) that they use in their data center. They also want to keep their options open in case they switch to another cloud in the future.

| **Launch the containers on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances in a cluster placement group**                 | ❌ Incorrect | This provides raw compute but no orchestration. You’d have to install and manage your own Kubernetes, making it non-managed and complex.                                                               |
| **Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Amazon EC2 instance worker nodes** | ❌ Incorrect | ECS is AWS-proprietary and not open source. This violates the cloud-agnostic and tooling reuse requirements.                                                                                           |
| **Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with AWS Fargate instances**            | ❌ Incorrect | Same limitation as above — ECS is AWS-specific. Fargate is serverless but still tied to ECS’s API.                                                                                                     |
| **Launch the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and EKS worker nodes**                 | ✅ Correct   | EKS is a **fully managed Kubernetes service**, allowing reuse of Kubernetes-native tools, YAML configs, Helm, and CI/CD integrations. Kubernetes is open-source and supported by many cloud providers. |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: When a question mentions:

- **Open-source tooling**
- **Cloud agnostic requirements**
- **Kubernetes-style control**
  — think **EKS**, not ECS.

**Tip**: ECS is AWS-native. Kubernetes (via EKS on AWS, or GKE on GCP, or AKS on Azure) supports the same tools and configs — making it the safest choice for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** provides a **fully managed Kubernetes control plane**, allowing teams to use open-source tooling like `kubectl`, `Helm`, and custom controllers — exactly the same tools used in on-prem environments.
- Kubernetes is inherently **cloud-agnostic**, supported by AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-prem solutions like Red Hat OpenShift or VMware Tanzu, making EKS the most flexible option for future cloud portability.
- Unlike ECS, which is **AWS-specific**, EKS enables consistent **deployment models, CI/CD pipelines, configuration files (YAML), and monitoring tools** across environments.
- **Worker nodes in EKS** can run on EC2 or Fargate, depending on how much control vs simplicity is required — but the orchestration layer remains Kubernetes.
- Deploying containers directly on EC2 (even in a placement group) gives full control but lacks orchestration, autoscaling, and API integration — not a managed or scalable solution for enterprise containerized workloads.

## Question 'SAA-Q011'

A company runs an application on an Amazon EC2 instance that requires 250 GB of storage space. The application is not used often and has small spikes in usage on weekday mornings and afternoons. The disk I/O can vary with peaks hitting a maximum of 3,000 IOPS. A Solutions Architect must recommend the most cost-effective storage solution that delivers the performance required.

**Which configuration should the Solutions Architect recommend?**

- Amazon EBS Cold HDD (sc1)
- Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
- Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
- Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)

---

## 1. In Simple English

The application doesn’t run all the time but occasionally spikes in disk usage, needing up to 3,000 IOPS. The architect must pick a storage type that’s **cheap** but can **handle those bursts** without over-provisioning.

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Focus on the performance metric that matters:

- **IOPS = gp2/io1**
- **Throughput = st1**
- **Archive/rare access = sc1**

Also consider whether the usage is bursty vs constant — gp2 shines when you want to **handle occasional peaks without paying full-time premium rates**.

**Tip**: gp2 volumes ≥ 250 GB get baseline 750 IOPS and can burst to 3,000 IOPS — perfect for this question’s workload.

| High throughput (not IOPS)         | EBS st1     |
| Rarely accessed archive storage    | EBS sc1     |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **EBS gp2 volumes scale IOPS linearly with size**, providing 3 IOPS per GB, with **bursting up to 3,000 IOPS** for volumes ≥ 250 GB. This makes gp2 ideal for applications that are mostly idle but need performance for short periods.
- The **burstable IOPS credit system** in gp2 allows volumes to temporarily exceed their baseline performance, especially when they’ve been idle and have accumulated I/O credits — which fits workloads with **predictable usage patterns** like this one (weekday spikes).
- **EBS io1** allows manually provisioning high IOPS, but it’s significantly more expensive and only necessary for **mission-critical, consistently high-I/O applications** like large databases.
- **EBS st1 and sc1** are **HDD-backed** — meaning they are good for throughput and cold storage, respectively, but **not suitable for transactional workloads** that demand IOPS responsiveness.
- This scenario represents a classic case for **gp2: moderate capacity, occasional spikes, no constant pressure**, and a strong need to **control costs** — making gp2 the optimal match.

## Question 'SAA-Q012'

There are two applications in a company: a sender application that sends messages containing payloads, and a processing application that receives messages containing payloads. The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between these two different applications. The sender application sends on average 1,000 messages each hour and the messages depending on the type sometimes take up to 2 days to be processed. If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages.

**Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?**

- Subscribe the processing application to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications. Write to the SNS topic using the sender application
- Set up a Redis database on Amazon EC2. Configure the instance to be used by both applications. The messages should be stored, processed, and deleted, respectively
- Provide an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the sender and processor applications. Set up a dead-letter queue to collect failed messages
- Receive the messages from the sender application using an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Utilize the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to integrate the processing application

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Look for keywords like:

- **“retain failed messages”**
- **“delayed processing”**
- **“processing takes hours or days”**

These indicate the need for a **queue with retry logic and durability**. Avoid SNS and Redis unless pub/sub or cache is explicitly requested.

**Tip**: SQS is your go-to service for reliable, decoupled communication between apps when ordering and latency aren’t strict but durability and fault tolerance are.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon SQS** is a **fully managed, decoupled message queuing service** that supports long polling, visibility timeouts, retries, and **dead-letter queues** — all essential for workflows with delayed or failed processing.
- SQS stores messages durably for **up to 14 days**, giving plenty of time for asynchronous or long-running jobs.
- A **dead-letter queue (DLQ)** in SQS allows failed messages to be automatically rerouted so they don't block the queue. This isolates issues while letting the rest of the queue continue processing.
- **Kinesis Data Streams** is built for **real-time analytics**, not transactional message processing — and is not ideal when processing times span hours or days.
- **SNS** is a **notification system**, not a queue. Messages are pushed to subscribers and discarded if they fail, unless another queue is layered in manually — increasing complexity.
- Using **Redis on EC2** for this use case adds operational overhead (management, scaling, backup, failure handling) and lacks the built-in safety and scalability features of managed AWS messaging services.

## Question 'SAA-Q013'

A video production company is planning to move some of its workloads to the AWS Cloud. The company will require around 5 TB of storage for video processing with the maximum possible I/O performance. They also require over 400 TB of extremely durable storage for storing video files and 800 TB of storage for long-term archival.

**Which combinations of services should a Solutions Architect use to meet these requirements?**

- Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 for archival storage.
- Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage.
- Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage.
- Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company needs three types of storage:

- Super-fast storage (5 TB) for video processing
- Very durable storage (400+ TB) for finalized video content
- Cheap, reliable storage (800 TB) for long-term archival

| Cold long-term archive | Amazon S3 Glacier  |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon EC2 instance store** offers extremely high **I/O throughput and minimal latency** because the storage is physically attached to the host. It's ideal for **temporary, high-speed data processing**, such as real-time video editing or rendering pipelines where data can be discarded or copied out afterward.
- However, **it is not persistent** — if the instance is stopped or fails, the data is **lost**. That’s why it's only suitable when the **application logic handles durability externally** (e.g., checkpointing to S3).
- **Amazon S3** is the best fit for storing **completed video files**, offering **11 9s durability**, seamless global access, and lifecycle rules that can transition objects automatically to archival tiers like Glacier.
- **Amazon S3 Glacier** is built for **massive archival workloads**, where data is rarely accessed. Its cost is a fraction of S3 Standard, making it perfect for storing **800 TB** of media archives that don’t need to be retrieved frequently.
- Choosing the **correct tiered approach** lets organizations like media and film studios **optimize for performance, durability, and cost — all at scale**.

## Question 'SAA-Q014'

A web application allows users to upload photos and add graphical elements to them. The application offers two tiers of service: free and paid. Photos uploaded by paid users should be processed before those submitted using the free tier. The photos are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket which uses an event notification to send the job information to Amazon SQS.

**How should a Solutions Architect configure the Amazon SQS deployment to meet these requirements?**

- Use a separate SQS FIFO queue for each tier. Set the free queue to use short polling and the paid queue to use long polling.
- Use one SQS standard queue. Use batching for the paid photos and short polling for the free photos.
- Use one SQS FIFO queue. Assign a higher priority to the paid photos so they are processed first.
- Use a separate SQS Standard queue for each tier. Configure Amazon EC2 instances to prioritize polling for the paid queue over the free queue.

---

## 1. In Simple English

We need to make sure **paid users’ photo jobs are processed first**. Photos from both free and paid users are sent to Amazon SQS via S3 events. The solution should respect the processing priority.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Always ask:

- Are the requirements based on **order** (FIFO) or **priority** (paid over free)?
- Does the AWS service natively support **priorities**?

**Tip**: When native priority is not supported (like in SQS), simulate it with **separate queues** and **custom polling logic** in the consumer application. This keeps architecture scalable and behavior predictable.

## 10. Summary Table

| Requirement                        | Best Practice                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Prioritize paid over free messages | Use two SQS standard queues         |
| Ensure high throughput             | Avoid FIFO, use SQS Standard        |
| Control processing order manually  | Prioritize polling on EC2 consumers |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon SQS does not support message prioritization natively**. Messages are processed in the order they are received (FIFO) or in no guaranteed order (Standard).
- To **enforce priority**, the best practice is to **separate workloads into different queues** and **control the polling behavior of consumers** (such as EC2 or Lambda).
- For example, EC2 worker instances can be programmed to poll the **paid queue first**, and only poll the **free queue** when the paid queue is empty. This ensures that paid users always receive faster processing without any native priority feature.
- **FIFO queues cannot prioritize one message group over another**, making them unsuitable for this use case.
- **Polling behavior (long or short polling)** affects latency and cost but does not enforce any priority between queues.
- By decoupling tiers into dedicated queues, you gain **greater control, scalability, and resilience** — making it an effective pattern for freemium or tiered-service applications in AWS.

## Question 'SAA-Q015'

A company runs an application in a factory that has a small rack of physical compute resources. The application stores data on a network attached storage (NAS) device using the NFS protocol. The company requires a daily offsite backup of the application data.

**Which solution can a Solutions Architect recommend to meet this requirement?**

- Use an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway with cached volumes on premises to replicate the data to Amazon S3.
- Use an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway hardware appliance on premises to replicate the data to Amazon S3.
- Create an IPSec VPN to AWS and configure the application to mount the Amazon EFS file system. Run a copy job to backup the data to EFS.
- Use an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway with stored volumes on premises to replicate the data to Amazon S3.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company needs to back up NFS-based application data from their on-premises NAS to AWS daily. The solution should support the NFS protocol and allow secure offsite backups with minimal disruption.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**: Match **protocol requirements** (NFS, SMB, iSCSI) to the **appropriate gateway type**:

- NFS/SMB → **File Gateway**
- iSCSI → **Volume Gateway**
- Tape backup → **Tape Gateway**

**Tip**: When you see "NAS" and "NFS", immediately lean toward **File Gateway**. Also consider if the option mentions **hardware appliance**, which is often required for disconnected or edge environments.

| Daily cloud backups     | Replication to Amazon S3         |
| Factory/edge deployment | File Gateway hardware appliance  |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway** is the **only gateway** that supports **file-based protocols like NFS and SMB**, making it ideal for backing up NAS systems.
- The **hardware appliance** version is often used in factory or edge environments where running a virtual gateway may not be feasible.
- File Gateway **stores files locally for low-latency access** and **asynchronously uploads them to Amazon S3**, ensuring durability without interrupting local workflows.
- This setup enables **seamless integration of on-premises NAS devices with S3 buckets**, effectively extending cloud storage into on-prem environments.
- **Volume Gateways**, although they replicate data to AWS, operate as **block devices (iSCSI)**, which cannot interface directly with NAS devices that use file protocols.
- Attempting to use **EFS over VPN** is not only complex but also less efficient and less supported compared to using a native **File Gateway**.
- Overall, for **file-based backup workflows**, File Gateway offers the **simplest, most reliable, and protocol-aligned** solution in the AWS hybrid storage toolkit.

## Question 'SAA-Q016'

An eCommerce company runs an application on Amazon EC2 instances in public and private subnets. The web application runs in a public subnet and the database runs in a private subnet. Both the public and private subnets are in a single Availability Zone (AZ).

**Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to provide high availability for this architecture?**  
_(Select TWO answers.)_

A. Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer that spans across multiple AZs.  
B. Create new public and private subnets in a different AZ. Create a database using Amazon EC2 in one AZ.  
C. Create an EC2 Auto Scaling group in the public subnet and use an Application Load Balancer.  
D. Create new public and private subnets in a different AZ. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployment.  
E. Create new public and private subnets in the same AZ but in a different Amazon VPC.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company has all their application resources in one Availability Zone. If that zone fails, everything goes down.  
To prevent that:

- The **web layer** should be spread across **multiple AZs** using an **Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group**.
- The **database** should be moved to **Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ** for automatic failover and replication.

## Question 'SAA-Q017'

An application running on Amazon EC2 needs to **asynchronously invoke** an AWS Lambda function to perform data processing. The services should be **decoupled**.

**Which service can be used to decouple the compute services?**  
_(Select ONE answer.)_

A. AWS Config  
B. AWS Step Functions  
C. Amazon SNS  
D. Amazon MQ

## 1. In Simple English

The EC2 instance needs to **trigger** a Lambda **without waiting for it to finish**.  
Also, EC2 and Lambda should be **loosely connected** — they shouldn't know each other's implementation details.

This is a perfect case for **decoupling using a messaging service**.

| A. AWS Config     | Completely unrelated; included as a red herring.                               |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Watch for decoupling and async keywords** — often implies SNS or SQS.
- **Match service capabilities with question constraints** — lightweight vs orchestration vs auditing.
- **Avoid heavy/managed brokers unless there's legacy system integration.**

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon SNS** is ideal for real-time, event-driven communication between loosely coupled services.  
  It supports **multiple subscribers** (e.g., Lambda, SQS, HTTP endpoints) and uses a **push model** — perfect for asynchronous triggers.

- While **Step Functions** are great for workflows, they're not the best for decoupling **generic compute producers** (like EC2) from **event consumers** (like Lambda).

- **Amazon MQ** is used when integrating systems that require **JMS**, **AMQP**, or **STOMP** protocols — typically in **hybrid** or **enterprise legacy** scenarios.

- For EC2 → Lambda **asynchronous triggers**, both **Amazon SNS** and **Amazon SQS** are viable, but **SNS** is better for immediate **event-based fan-out** use cases.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **CloudFront Price Classes** allow you to **limit edge location coverage** to save on cost.

  - `Price Class 100` = US, Canada, Europe (lowest cost).
  - `Price Class 200` = Includes Asia + Middle East.
  - `Price Class All` = All edge locations globally (highest cost).

- **Edge locations** are where caching happens, not where S3 buckets must reside. Your S3 bucket can still be in a single region.

- **Lambda@Edge** is useful for header manipulation, redirects, or AB testing — **not needed for static brochure delivery**.

- Always use **CloudFront with S3 static websites** to improve performance and reduce global latency, especially with **geo-constrained audiences**.

## Question 'SAA-Q019'

A solutions architect is designing an application on AWS. The **compute layer will run in parallel across EC2 instances**. The compute layer should **scale based on the number of jobs to be processed**. The compute layer is **stateless**.

The solutions architect must ensure that the application is **loosely coupled** and the **job items are durably stored**.

**Which design should the solutions architect use?**  
_(Select ONE answer.)_

A. Create an Amazon SNS topic to send the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group for the compute application. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on the number of messages published to the SNS topic.  
B. Create an Amazon SQS queue to hold the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group for the compute application. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on network usage.  
C. Create an Amazon SNS topic to send the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group for the compute application. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on CPU usage.  
D. Create an Amazon SQS queue to hold the jobs that need to be processed. Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group for the compute application. Set the scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to add and remove nodes based on the number of items in the SQS queue.

---

## 1. In Simple English

You have a batch-style app where jobs come in, get processed by EC2 instances, and you want:

- **Stateless compute**, so EC2s can come/go.
- **Durable job storage**, so jobs aren't lost.
- **Auto-scaling**, to handle more jobs when they come in.
- **Loose coupling**, so the producer doesn’t need to know about the compute layer directly.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon SQS** is a fully managed message queue that supports **durable** storage of tasks. It's ideal for decoupling producers from consumers in scalable architectures.

- You can configure **Auto Scaling Group policies** that monitor the SQS **ApproximateNumberOfMessages** metric to increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances dynamically based on backlog.

- **Stateless compute nodes** are perfect for queue-based processing because they don’t retain session data. They can be replaced or scaled without impact.

- **Amazon SNS** is suited for **event fan-out** or **push notifications**, but does **not retain messages** and is not directly tied to Auto Scaling policy metrics.

## Question 'SAA-Q021'

A company is working with a **strategic partner** that has an application which must be able to **send messages** to one of the company’s **Amazon SQS queues**. The partner company has its **own AWS account**.

**How can a Solutions Architect provide least privilege access to the partner?**  
_(Select ONE answer.)_

A. Update the permission policy on the SQS queue to grant all permissions to the partner’s AWS account.  
B. Update the permission policy on the SQS queue to grant the `sqs:SendMessage` permission to the partner’s AWS account.  
C. Create a user account and grant the `sqs:SendMessage` permission for Amazon SQS. Share the credentials with the partner company.  
D. Create a cross-account role with access to all SQS queues and use the partner's AWS account in the trust document for the role.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company needs to let a **partner AWS account send messages** into an existing **SQS queue**. The partner shouldn’t be allowed to delete or read messages — just send them.  
The solution should apply the **least privilege** rule and keep everything **secure, simple, and AWS-native**.

| ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A      | ❌      | Grants more than needed (`DeleteMessage`, `PurgeQueue`, etc.). Violates least privilege.                  |
| B      | ✅      | Grants exactly what’s needed (`SendMessage`) using a resource-based policy. Secure and minimal.           |
| C      | ❌      | IAM user sharing is insecure and against AWS best practices.                                              |
| D      | ❌      | Cross-account roles are useful, but not necessary for this use case — and it grants access to all queues. |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Start with the verb** — what action is needed? (Send only? Read? Delete?)
- **Identify the subject** — is this a user, account, or service?
- Use **resource-based policies** (like SQS or S3) when you want to **grant access to an external account**.
- Use **IAM roles** only when the external party needs to assume a role for broader access.

| Cross-account support    | ✅ Resource policy on SQS |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

When a third-party or partner organization needs to send data to an SQS queue in **your account**, the **simplest and most secure method** is to use a **resource-based access policy** on the queue itself.

Here's how this works:

- **Amazon SQS** supports attaching **resource policies** that specify which external AWS account (by `Account ID`) is allowed to perform specific actions.
- In this case, the partner **only needs permission to call `SendMessage`**, so your policy should **only include that action**.
- The **partner’s application** assumes a role **within their own account**, and uses their identity to call the SQS endpoint **in your account**, authorized by the policy you’ve attached.

Here is an example of such a policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "QueuePolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::PARTNER_ACCOUNT_ID:root"
      },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:YourQueueName"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Question 'SAA-Q022'

Storage capacity has become an issue for a company that runs **application servers on-premises**. The servers are connected to a combination of **block storage** and **NFS storage** solutions. The company requires a solution that supports **local caching** without **re-architecting its existing applications**.

**Which combination of changes can the company make to meet these requirements?**  
_(Select TWO answers.)_

A. Use the mount command on servers to mount Amazon S3 buckets using NFS.  
B. Use Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volumes to replace the block storage.  
C. Use an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to replace the NFS storage.  
D. Use an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway to replace the block storage.  
E. Use AWS Direct Connect and mount an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server using iSCSI.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to **expand storage capacity**, but their apps are **on-premises** and can't be changed. They currently use:

- **Block storage** (like iSCSI or SAN disks), and
- **NFS (Network File System)** shared storage.

They need a **hybrid solution** that gives them access to **cloud-backed storage** with **local caching**, while keeping their existing file/block interface intact.

| A. Mount S3 using NFS                                                  | ❌      | Not natively possible. S3 is object storage and doesn’t support NFS mounts directly via standard `mount`. Requires third-party tools like s3fs or custom apps. |
| B. Use EFS to replace block storage                                    | ❌      | EFS is a file system (NFS-based) — not a block storage replacement. It can’t mimic the behavior of local block devices.                                        |
| C. Use AWS Storage Gateway **file gateway** to replace NFS storage     | ✅      | File Gateway exposes a **NFS/SMB interface**, backed by S3 with local caching. Perfect for NFS replacement with minimal changes.                               |
| D. Use AWS Storage Gateway **volume gateway** to replace block storage | ✅      | Volume Gateway provides block-level iSCSI storage, backed by S3, with local caching. Seamlessly integrates with existing block storage setups.                 |
| E. Use Direct Connect and mount FSx via iSCSI                          | ❌      | Amazon FSx for Windows uses **SMB**, not iSCSI. Also requires app compatibility and does not provide local caching for on-prem use.                            |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

When migrating or extending on-premises storage to AWS **without rewriting applications**, the **AWS Storage Gateway** family offers purpose-built solutions:

- **File Gateway** lets on-prem systems access cloud-backed storage using **standard NFS or SMB protocols**, with **local cache** for low-latency reads and buffering writes. This is ideal for applications expecting a traditional file share, such as what NFS-based workloads rely on. File Gateway automatically stores data in Amazon S3 in object format, yet presents a filesystem-like interface on-prem.

- **Volume Gateway** provides **block storage** using the iSCSI protocol. Applications see it as a local disk, but data is stored in S3 in the backend. You can configure it in:
  - **Cached mode**, where the most frequently accessed data is stored locally, and the rest is fetched on-demand.
  - **Stored mode**, where the primary data is kept on-premises and backed up asynchronously to AWS.

These services allow for **incremental cloud adoption** while preserving legacy interfaces.

**What doesn’t work:**

- **Mounting S3 as NFS** is not supported by AWS natively. While third-party tools (like `s3fs`) exist, they are not reliable or supported in production.
- **EFS** is a cloud-only NFS solution — it can’t be directly mounted by on-prem servers unless through EC2 or via Transit Gateway with strict conditions.
- **Amazon FSx for Windows** is a fully managed SMB file system, but it's **not compatible with iSCSI** and has **no local cache** for on-prem reads.

Bottom line: **Storage Gateway** is AWS’s purpose-built hybrid solution for bridging on-prem workloads and cloud storage while offering **protocol compatibility and local caching**, which are key to seamless integration with legacy apps.

## Question 'SAA-Q023'

A company's application is running on **Amazon EC2 instances in a single Region**. In the event of a disaster, a Solutions Architect needs to ensure that the resources can also be **deployed to a second Region**.

**Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to accomplish this?**  
_(Select TWO answers.)_

A. Copy an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume from Amazon S3 and launch an EC2 instance in the second Region using that EBS volume  
B. Detach a volume on an EC2 instance and copy it to an Amazon S3 bucket in the second Region  
C. Launch a new EC2 instance from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in the second Region  
D. Launch a new EC2 instance in the second Region and copy a volume from Amazon S3 to the new instance  
E. Copy an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of an EC2 instance and specify the second Region for the destination

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app is running in one AWS Region, but we need a **backup plan** to deploy it in a **different Region** in case something goes wrong.  
We need to **replicate EC2-related resources** (like AMIs and EBS volumes) to a **different Region** so the app can be relaunched quickly.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- For **EC2 disaster recovery**, focus on **AMI replication and snapshot strategy**.
- **Don’t assume S3 is a direct destination for EBS volumes** unless talking about snapshots (even then, the process is abstracted).
- Always **launch EC2 from AMIs**, not from copied EBS volumes or S3 buckets.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

In AWS, the most reliable way to enable **cross-Region disaster recovery** for EC2 instances is through the **replication of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**. An AMI includes both the **boot volume snapshot** and the **launch configuration metadata** (such as instance type, root device, block mapping, etc.).

Here’s how it works:

1. **Create an AMI** of your EC2 instance (which internally uses an EBS snapshot).
2. **Copy that AMI** to the desired **target Region** using the console or CLI with the `--destination-region` parameter.
3. Once the AMI is present in the target Region, you can **launch a new EC2 instance** using that AMI, just like you would in the original Region.

EBS snapshots themselves **can be copied across Regions**, but that process does not automatically create a bootable AMI in the destination Region. You would need to **register a new AMI** using that snapshot — a more complex process compared to just copying the AMI directly.

Misconceptions:

- While **EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 under the hood**, you **cannot access or mount them via S3** like files. There is **no valid method** to copy volumes from EC2 to S3 manually and relaunch from them.
- You **cannot launch an EC2 instance directly from a volume copied to S3**.
- You **cannot use `mount` to attach bootable volumes from S3**.

**Best practice:**  
For DR preparedness, include **regular AMI creation and cross-region copying** as part of your backup lifecycle policy or automation workflow. AWS Backup and Lifecycle Manager can help automate this.

## Question 'SAA-Q024'

A new application is to be published in **multiple regions around the world**. The Architect needs to ensure that **only 2 IP addresses need to be whitelisted**. The solution should **intelligently route traffic for lowest latency** and provide **fast regional failover**.

**How can this be achieved?**  
_(Select ONE answer.)_

A. Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an NLB with a static IP address  
B. Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an ALB and use Amazon CloudFront with a pair of static IP addresses  
C. Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an ALB and use a Route 53 failover routing policy  
D. Launch EC2 instances into multiple regions behind an NLB and use AWS Global Accelerator

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants their app deployed globally.  
They want:

- **Only two IPs** to whitelist (e.g., for firewalls or client-side policies)
- **Low latency routing** (users should go to the closest region)
- **Automatic failover** if a region goes down

So the solution must provide:

- **Global routing intelligence**
- **Fixed/static entry points**
- **Fast failover and health checking**

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

**AWS Global Accelerator** is the **only native AWS service** that provides:

- **Two static IP addresses** (anycast) for global traffic entry.
- **Automatic, health-based failover** across AWS Regions in under 30 seconds.
- **Lowest-latency routing** using the AWS global network backbone — users are routed to the closest healthy endpoint.

In this architecture:

- You deploy **EC2 instances** behind **NLBs** in multiple AWS Regions.
- You attach those NLBs to **AWS Global Accelerator** as endpoints.
- Global Accelerator then handles **traffic steering, health checks, and global failover**.
- Clients only need to **whitelist the two IPs** of the accelerator — no matter where the traffic ends up geographically.

**Why not ALB or CloudFront?**

- ALB **does not support static IPs**.
- CloudFront is a **CDN**, not a global router for dynamic apps.
- Route 53 **does not provide static IPs** and **failover is DNS-based**, which means slow TTL propagation and lack of IP-based firewall compatibility.

**Bottom line:** When you see a requirement for:

- **Global reach**
- **Static IPs**
- **Latency-based routing**
- **Fast health-based failover**  
  👉 The best AWS-native solution is **Global Accelerator with NLBs in each region**.

## Question 'SAA-Q025'

A company requires that **all AWS IAM user accounts** have specific **complexity requirements and minimum password length**.

**How should a Solutions Architect accomplish this?**  
_(Select ONE answer.)_

A. Set a password policy for the entire AWS account.  
B. Set a password policy for each IAM user in the AWS account.

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to make sure that **every IAM user has a strong password**. That means:

- A certain **minimum length**
- Rules like **uppercase, lowercase, symbols, numbers**, etc.

You want to **set this at the account level** so that **all users** are automatically affected.

| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B      | Sounds logical, but AWS does not support user-level password policies.                  |
| C      | AWS Config is monitoring-only; it doesn’t apply enforcement during creation.            |
| D      | IAM policies are for access control, not credential formatting or password enforcement. |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Password settings → always account-level** in AWS.
- **IAM policies** = permission enforcement only.
- **AWS Config** = compliance monitoring, not enforcement.
- Look for “password complexity” or “password policy” = points to **account-level setting** in IAM.

| Control permissions, not passwords | ❌ IAM policy                     |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

An **IAM password policy** is an **account-level configuration** that applies to **all IAM users** in the AWS account who are allowed to sign in using a password (i.e., the AWS Management Console).

With a password policy, you can enforce rules such as:

- **Minimum password length**
- **Character complexity**: Require at least one uppercase, lowercase, symbol, or number
- **Password expiration**
- **Password reuse prevention**
- **Allow users to change their own password**

Here’s how to implement it:

1. Navigate to the IAM console.
2. Go to **Account Settings**.
3. Set a password policy with the required rules.

**Why not IAM policies?**  
IAM policies control **what users are allowed to do**, like accessing S3 or invoking Lambda. They don’t control how users **authenticate**.

**Why not AWS Config?**  
AWS Config is for **tracking and auditing** configuration compliance. You can **detect if a password policy exists**, but Config can’t create or enforce one.

**Best Practice:**  
Always enforce a strong password policy **at the account level**, and **use MFA** for all privileged users. Combine this with **IAM access analyzer**, **CloudTrail**, and **Config rules** for comprehensive security oversight.

## Question 'SAA-Q028'

An Amazon VPC contains several Amazon EC2 instances. The instances need to make API calls to Amazon DynamoDB. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the API calls do not traverse the internet. How can this be accomplished? _(Select TWO.)_

## Options:

- Create a VPC peering connection between the VPC and DynamoDB
- Create a new DynamoDB table that uses the endpoint
- Create a gateway endpoint for DynamoDB
- Create a route table entry for the endpoint
- Create an ENI for the endpoint in each of the subnets of the VPC

| Option                    | Why It's Tricky                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VPC peering connection    | Suggests direct connection but DynamoDB doesn't support peering        |
| Create new DynamoDB table | Implies endpoint configuration is table-specific rather than VPC-level |
| Create an ENI             | Interface endpoints use ENIs, but DynamoDB requires gateway endpoints  |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

1. **Identify service type**: DynamoDB → gateway endpoint (not interface)
2. **Eliminate impossible options**:
   - Peering (not supported for managed services)
   - ENIs (only for interface endpoints)
3. **Select configuration pairs**:
   - Endpoint creation + route table update
4. **Ignore misleading options** about table creation

**Tip:** For DynamoDB/S3 private access, always think "gateway endpoint + route tables".

| Security            | IAM policies still apply | Endpoint doesn't bypass existing authentication/authorization |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

**Critical Details About Gateway Endpoints:**

- **No Availability Risk**: Doesn't use ENIs, so no subnet dependency
- **Routing Logic**: Requires explicit route table entries pointing to `pl-xxxxxx`
- **Service-Specific**: Each endpoint only works for one service (S3 or DynamoDB)

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create endpoint in VPC console (select DynamoDB)
2. Associate with route tables used by EC2 instances
3. Add route with destination `pl-xxxxxx` to endpoint
4. Verify connectivity using VPC Flow Logs

**Security Considerations:**

- Combine with DynamoDB resource policies for fine-grained access
- Monitor endpoint traffic via CloudWatch metrics
- Gateway endpoints don't support cross-region access

## Question 'SAA-Q029'

An AWS Organization has an OU with multiple member accounts in it. The company needs to restrict the ability to launch only specific Amazon EC2 instance types. How can this policy be applied across the accounts with the least effort?  
_(Single answer)_

## Options:

- Use AWS Resource Access Manager to control which launch types can be used
- Create an SCP with an allow rule that allows launching the specific instance types
- Create an SCP with a deny rule that denies all but the specific instance types
- Create an IAM policy to deny launching all but the specific instance types

---

## 1. In Simple English

We need to limit which EC2 instance types can be launched across multiple AWS accounts in an Organization, using the simplest method.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

1. **Identify scope**: Organization-wide → Think SCPs (not IAM)
2. **Determine restriction type**:
   - Deny unwanted actions (most secure)
   - Avoid allow-lists (too permissive)
3. **Eliminate non-governance services**:
   - RAM is for sharing, not restricting
4. **Choose most efficient**:
   - SCP applied at OU level affects all accounts automatically

**Tip:** For organization-wide restrictions, SCP deny rules are usually the answer.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

**Why SCP Deny Rules Win:**

- **Inheritance**: Automatically applies to all accounts in the OU
- **Deny Precedence**: Overrides any per-account IAM allow permissions
- **EC2 Control**: Can restrict by:
  - Instance type (e.g., `t2.*`)
  - Region
  - AMI IDs

**Sample SCP Policy:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "ec2:InstanceType": ["t3.micro", "m5.large"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Differentiators:

1. **SCP Strategy Focus**: Highlighted why deny rules are preferred over allow rules in SCPs
2. **Policy Example**: Included actual JSON policy snippet in Key Facts
3. **IAM vs SCP Contrast**: Emphasized the organizational vs account-level control difference
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Added practical testing and monitoring tips

This maintains your preferred structure while addressing the organizational governance aspects of this question. The analysis shows why SCPs are superior to IAM for cross-account restrictions.

### Question 'SAA-Q030'

A Solutions Architect is creating a **document submission application for a school**. The application will use an **Amazon S3 bucket** for storage.

The solution must:

- **Prevent accidental deletion** of documents
- **Ensure all versions** of the documents are available
- Users must be able to **upload and modify** documents.

**Which combination of actions should be taken to meet these requirements?**  
_(Select TWO answers.)_

A. Enable versioning on the bucket  
B. Set read-only permissions on the bucket  
C. Enable MFA Delete on the bucket  
D. Encrypt the bucket using AWS SSE-S3  
E. Attach an IAM policy to the bucket

---

## 1. In Simple English

This app stores user-submitted documents in S3.  
The school wants to make sure:

- Files aren't deleted by mistake
- Old versions of files are preserved even after updates
- Users can still upload and edit their documents

| Realism      | Common scenario in education and regulated document handling systems.                 |
| Completeness | Mixes required features (versioning, MFA delete) with distractors (read-only bucket). |
| Traps        | Encryption is a best practice but unrelated to versioning/deletion; IAM policy vague. |

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S3 Versioning             | Keeps multiple versions of an object — protects against overwrites and deletion. |
| MFA Delete                | Adds protection against version deletions — especially for privileged accounts.  |
| Permissions vs Protection | Read-only permissions would prevent required upload/modify functionality.        |
| Encryption                | Important for confidentiality, but not required for deletion/versioning needs.   |

| A. Enable versioning on the bucket         | ✅      | Preserves every version of a document — required for version history and deletion protection.                                                       |
| B. Set read-only permissions on the bucket | ❌      | Would block users from uploading/modifying documents — violates functional requirement.                                                             |
| C. Enable MFA Delete on the bucket         | ✅      | Prevents even administrators from deleting object versions without MFA. Adds an extra layer of deletion protection.                                 |
| D. Encrypt the bucket using AWS SSE-S3     | ❌      | Good practice for securing data, but doesn’t help with versioning or preventing deletions.                                                          |
| E. Attach an IAM policy to the bucket      | ❌      | IAM policies can restrict access, but don’t guarantee versioning or prevent deletion unless explicitly written — too vague without further context. |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon S3 Versioning** is a powerful mechanism that allows you to **retain all versions of an object**, including overwritten or deleted ones. If a user deletes a file, a **delete marker** is added, but the actual object still exists unless **permanently deleted**.

- **MFA Delete** adds a **second layer of protection** against accidental or unauthorized deletions. It requires that the requestor provide a valid **multi-factor authentication token** when attempting to **permanently delete an object version or disable versioning** — particularly useful for protecting against administrator error or compromise.

- Note: **MFA Delete can only be enabled using the AWS CLI or SDK**, not via the AWS Management Console.

- While **SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys)** ensures that data at rest is encrypted, it doesn't help with **accidental deletion or version retention**.

- **IAM policies** can grant or deny access to specific S3 actions, but they must be explicitly written to restrict deletions — and even then, without versioning, deletes are permanent.

Bottom line: For preserving document history and preventing unintended data loss in an S3-based app, **versioning and MFA Delete** are the best tools in your architectural toolbox.

### Question 'SAA-Q031'

A company is investigating methods to reduce the expenses associated with on-premises backup infrastructure. The Solutions Architect wants to reduce costs by eliminating the use of physical backup tapes. It is a requirement that existing backup applications and workflows should continue to function. What should the Solutions Architect recommend?

(A) Connect the backup applications to an AWS Storage Gateway using the iSCSI protocol.  
(B) Create an Amazon EFS file system and connect the backup applications using the iSCSI protocol.  
(C) Connect the backup applications to an AWS Storage Gateway using an iSCSI-virtual tape library (VTL).  
(D) Create an Amazon EFS file system and connect the backup applications using the NFS protocol.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to stop using physical tapes to back up their data but doesn’t want to change how their backup software works. AWS offers a service called Tape Gateway that lets old software keep working while storing the data in the cloud instead of tapes.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions (Strategy + Tip)

- Always **match the data type to the correct gateway flavor**:
  - File Gateway → for NFS/SMB
  - Volume Gateway → for iSCSI block volumes
  - Tape Gateway → for tape emulation over iSCSI
- Look for phrases like **"existing backup workflows must continue"** — this signals **Tape Gateway** is the right choice.

**Tip:** If the question involves backup tapes + iSCSI + legacy software → go with **Tape Gateway**.

- **Tape Gateway** allows your existing software to treat AWS like a physical tape robot.
- Data written to tapes is initially stored in S3 and can be archived to Glacier for long-term savings.
- No re-architecting is required—Tape Gateway uses standard media changer commands.
- You can export virtual tapes to Glacier Deep Archive for ultra-low-cost storage.
- Ideal for organizations looking to **migrate off tapes without migrating off workflows**.

### Question 'SAA-Q032'

A solutions architect is designing a new service that will use an Amazon API Gateway API on the frontend. The service will need to persist data in a backend database using key-value requests. Initially, the data requirements will be around 1 GB and future growth is unknown. Requests can range from 0 to over 800 requests per second. Which combination of AWS services would meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)

(A) AWS Lambda  
(B) Amazon DynamoDB  
(C) AWS Fargate  
(D) Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling  
(E) Amazon RDS

---

## 1. In Simple English

You need to build a service that:

- Starts small (1 GB data),
- Handles unpredictable traffic (0–800+ RPS),
- Uses key-value database access,
- And is fronted by API Gateway.

You need a **scalable backend compute** (for the API requests) and a **key-value database** that can grow and scale seamlessly.

## Question 'SAA-Q033'

The database tier of a web application is running on a Windows server on-premises. The database is a Microsoft SQL Server database. The application owner would like to migrate the database to an Amazon RDS instance.

**How can the migration be executed with minimal administrative effort and downtime?**

- Use the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to directly migrate the database to RDS
- Use AWS DataSync to migrate the data from the database to Amazon S3. Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate the database to RDS
- Use the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to directly migrate the database to RDS. Use the Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to enable conversion from Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS
- Use the AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) to migrate the server to Amazon EC2. Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate the database to RDS

---

## 1. In Simple English

You have a Microsoft SQL Server database running on-premises. You want to move it to Amazon RDS with as little downtime and effort as possible. The best AWS tool for this job is **AWS DMS**, which can continuously replicate changes during the migration, minimizing downtime.

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: <br> Use the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to directly migrate the database to RDS**

| Option                        | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use DMS to migrate to RDS** | ✅ Correct   | SQL Server is supported by Amazon RDS. Since the source and target engines are the same, schema conversion is not needed. DMS can migrate the data and keep the source in sync until cutover. |
| **Use DataSync + DMS**        | ❌ Incorrect | DataSync is used for file-based data (e.g., S3, EFS, NFS), not for live databases. It’s unnecessary here.                                                                                     |
| **Use DMS + SCT**             | ❌ Incorrect | SCT is needed only for heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle → PostgreSQL). SQL Server → SQL Server does **not** require SCT.                                                                |
| **Use SMS + DMS**             | ❌ Incorrect | SMS migrates entire VMs, not just databases. It’s overly complex and irrelevant here because the goal is to move to **RDS**, not EC2.                                                         |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- First, identify the source and target DB engines. If they match → no SCT needed.
- If downtime must be minimized → use **AWS DMS** with **ongoing replication**.
- Eliminate file-based or VM-based tools unless file shares or server states are explicitly mentioned.

**Tip:** SQL Server to Amazon RDS for SQL Server = homogeneous migration → use DMS only.

| Migrate SQL Server DB to RDS          | AWS DMS                |
| Same engine (SQL Server → SQL Server) | No SCT needed          |
| Low admin effort, minimal downtime    | AWS DMS with sync mode |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **AWS DMS** supports both full and continuous data replication. This means you can migrate the entire SQL Server DB and then keep it in sync with live changes until you cut over.
- **SCT** is needed only when you're migrating between different DB engines (e.g., Oracle → Aurora PostgreSQL).
- **Amazon RDS** for SQL Server is a managed DB offering, so there's no need to migrate the full VM, OS, or application stack.
- **SMS** is overkill and unrelated unless you’re rehosting the full server, which is not the case here.

## Question 'SAA-Q034'

A solutions architect is designing the infrastructure to run an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application requires high availability and must dynamically scale based on demand to be cost efficient.

**What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?**

- Configure an Application Load Balancer in front of an Auto Scaling group to deploy instances to multiple Regions
- Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of an Auto Scaling group to deploy instances to multiple Regions
- Configure an Application Load Balancer in front of an Auto Scaling group to deploy instances to multiple Availability Zones
- Configure an Amazon API Gateway API in front of an Auto Scaling group to deploy instances to multiple Availability Zones

---

## 1. In Simple English

The application needs to:

- Run on EC2 instances
- Be **highly available**
- **Scale automatically** based on traffic
- Be **cost-efficient**

The correct solution is to combine **Auto Scaling** (for elasticity) with an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** across **multiple Availability Zones**, ensuring both high availability and scaling.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** distributes incoming HTTP(S) traffic to EC2 instances across **multiple AZs**, enhancing fault tolerance.
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** can span multiple AZs, adding or removing EC2 instances based on demand or metrics (like CPU usage).
- **High availability** in AWS is typically designed at the **Availability Zone level** within a **single Region**.
- **Multi-Region deployments** involve DNS-based failover (e.g., Route 53) or Global Accelerator — not just load balancers and ASGs.
- **API Gateway** is not intended to front EC2 directly — it connects more naturally to serverless backends (e.g., Lambda, HTTP APIs).

- **AWS DataSync** supports incremental transfers, encryption in transit, scheduling, monitoring via CloudWatch, and bandwidth throttling.
- It integrates natively with **AWS Direct Connect** for secure and faster private transfer between on-prem data centers and AWS.
- DataSync uses a dedicated agent VM installed on-premises to read from local file shares (NFS or SMB).
- Compared to DMS, which only supports structured data like SQL or NoSQL databases, DataSync works directly with the **file system layer**.
- Snowball is more appropriate when there’s no network or when the dataset is multiple petabytes — not ideal when Direct Connect is available.

## Question 'SAA-Q036'

A company runs a web application that serves weather updates. The application runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The instances store data in an Amazon Aurora database.

A solutions architect needs to make the application more **resilient to sporadic increases in request rates**.

**Which architecture should the solutions architect implement? (Select TWO.)**

- Add an AWS WAF in front of the ALB
- Add an AWS Transit Gateway to the Availability Zones
- Add Amazon Aurora Replicas
- Add an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint
- Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the ALB

---

## 1. In Simple English

The web app gets **random traffic spikes**, and the architect wants to make it **more resilient**. That means it should:

- Scale quickly,
- Handle more read traffic on the database side,
- Offload or absorb incoming traffic at the edge if possible.

The best answers involve adding:

- **CloudFront**, which caches and absorbs surges at the edge,
- **Aurora Replicas**, which handle read scaling and prevent DB bottlenecks.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Look for **scaling pressure points**: frontend traffic? database load?
- Address them with the correct services:
  - **CloudFront** or **ALB** for web traffic
  - **Aurora Replicas** or **Read Replicas** for database read scaling
  - **Auto Scaling Groups** for compute elasticity

**Tip:** CloudFront and Aurora Replicas are go-to answers for improving performance and resilience under high traffic.

## Question 'SAA-Q037'

A new application will run across multiple Amazon ECS tasks. Front-end application logic will process data and then pass that data to a back-end ECS task to perform further processing and write the data to a datastore.

The Architect would like to **reduce interdependencies** so **failures do not impact other components**.

**Which solution should the Architect use?**

- Create an Amazon SQS queue that pushes messages to the back-end. Configure the front-end to add messages to the queue
- Create an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that delivers data to an Amazon S3 bucket, configure the front-end to write data to the stream and the back-end to read data from Amazon S3
- Create an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream and configure the front-end to add data to the stream and the back-end to read data from the stream
- Create an Amazon SQS queue and configure the front-end to add messages to the queue and the back-end to poll the queue for messages

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app runs in parts: the front-end does one job and the back-end does another. If the back-end breaks, the front-end should keep going. So, we need a **buffer (queue)** between them. The best way to do this in AWS is with **SQS**, where the front-end sends messages and the back-end **polls** them when it’s ready.

## 2. Verbiage & Realism

| Aspect         | Assessment                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clarity        | Very clear — reduce interdependency and avoid failure propagation between ECS tasks.           |
| Realism        | Highly realistic pattern for decoupled microservices in production systems.                    |
| Trap Potential | High — similar-sounding answers involving Firehose may distract from the best SQS-based model. |

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decoupling microservices                | SQS is the right tool to buffer messages between components and reduce tight coupling.      |
| Understanding message vs stream systems | Kinesis Firehose is not optimized for request/response or short-latency task messaging.     |
| Correct use of SQS polling              | The consumer (back-end task) should **poll** the queue, not wait for a push from the queue. |
| Durable, scalable communication         | SQS provides durable delivery and retry for asynchronous backend processing.                |

| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQS that pushes messages to the back-end**           | ❌ Incorrect | SQS is **pull-based** — you cannot push messages directly. Consumers must poll.                                     |
| **Kinesis Firehose to S3 + back-end reads S3**         | ❌ Incorrect | Firehose is for bulk data delivery to storage (e.g., S3, Redshift), not for direct service communication.           |
| **Kinesis Firehose with direct backend stream access** | ❌ Incorrect | Firehose doesn’t support direct reads from consumers. That would require Kinesis Data Streams, not Firehose.        |
| **SQS with front-end writing and back-end polling**    | ✅ Correct   | This pattern properly decouples ECS tasks, allowing front-end to remain unaffected if back-end is delayed or fails. |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Look for **asynchronous, decoupled communication** → think **SQS**
- Check for **data vs message context**:
  - Firehose → data streaming/delivery
  - SQS → component messaging

**Tip:** When decoupling ECS tasks or microservices, SQS is the safest choice to keep each part independent and fault-tolerant.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon SQS** is a pull-based message queuing service used to decouple application components.
- It supports **standard queues** (best-effort ordering, high throughput) and **FIFO queues** (exact ordering, limited throughput).
- **Decoupling ECS tasks** via SQS allows each task to operate independently and recover from failure gracefully.
- Firehose is more appropriate for logging, telemetry, and data ingestion into analytics/storage platforms — not inter-task communication.
- SQS integrates seamlessly with ECS, Lambda, and other AWS services and supports dead-letter queues, retries, and visibility timeouts for resiliency.

## Question 'SAA-Q038'

A Solutions Architect has deployed an application on several Amazon EC2 instances across three private subnets. The application must be made accessible to internet-based clients with the least amount of administrative effort.

**How can the Solutions Architect make the application available on the internet?**

- Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet. Add a route to the NAT gateway to the route tables of the three private subnets
- Create an Application Load Balancer and associate three public subnets from the same Availability Zones as the private instances. Add the private instances to the ALB
- Create an Application Load Balancer and associate three private subnets from the same Availability Zones as the private instances. Add the private instances to the ALB
- Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of the instances in the private subnet and launch new instances from the AMI in public subnets. Create an Application Load Balancer and add the public instances to the ALB

---

## 1. In Simple English

You have EC2 instances running in **private subnets** and need to allow **internet users** to access the application they run. The easiest and most secure way to do this is to put a **public-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in **public subnets**, and then register the private EC2 instances behind it.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Always assume **inbound internet access** requires a **public ALB**, not moving EC2 instances to public subnets.
- **NAT** is only useful when instances **in private subnets** need **outbound** internet access (e.g., to install packages).
- Avoid solutions that suggest modifying subnets or creating new instances unless the question _explicitly_ calls for it.

**Tip:** When your app is in **private subnets**, the best way to expose it is through **a public ALB** in public subnets.

- **NAT Gateways** are useful for **outbound traffic**, such as downloading patches or updates from the internet.
- Creating an AMI and relaunching in public subnets **increases risk** and management overhead without adding value in this case.
- This architecture is a core **AWS well-architected best practice**: separation of frontend/public components and backend/private compute.

## Question 'SAA-Q039'

A company runs an application on six web application servers in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in a single Availability Zone. The application is fronted by an Application Load Balancer (ALB). A Solutions Architect needs to modify the infrastructure to be highly available **without making any modifications to the application**.

**Which architecture should the Solutions Architect choose to enable high availability?**

- Create an Auto Scaling group to launch three instances across each of two Regions
- Modify the Auto Scaling group to use two instances across each of three Availability Zones
- Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with a custom origin across multiple Regions
- Create a launch template that can be used to quickly create more instances in another Region

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app is currently running in **just one Availability Zone**, which means it's vulnerable to **zone failure**. To make it highly available, we must **spread the EC2 instances across multiple AZs** within the **same Region**, without changing the application code.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Default to **multi-AZ** deployment when high availability is required and app changes are not allowed.
- Avoid multi-Region unless global access or disaster recovery is specifically required.
- Auto Scaling Groups and ALBs support multi-AZ by default — just configure them properly.

**Tip:** High availability ≠ multi-Region. Use **multiple AZs** in a single Region unless otherwise stated.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- AWS defines **high availability** in terms of **fault tolerance** across **Availability Zones**.
- **Auto Scaling Groups** can span multiple AZs within the same Region and balance EC2 instances automatically.
- **Application Load Balancers** can route traffic across AZs — you just need to enable the AZs in the ALB settings.
- **Multi-Region failover** is typically used for **disaster recovery** or **global latency optimization**, not basic HA.
- The correct answer leverages AWS’s shared-responsibility model and managed services — no app changes, no overengineering.

## Question 'SAA-Q040'

An application running on an Amazon ECS container instance using the EC2 launch type needs permissions to write data to Amazon DynamoDB.

**How can you assign these permissions only to the specific ECS task that is running the application?**

- Create an IAM policy with permissions to DynamoDB and attach it to the container instance
- Use a security group to allow outbound connections to DynamoDB and assign it to the container instance
- Modify the AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy policy to add permissions for DynamoDB
- Create an IAM policy with permissions to DynamoDB and assign it to a task using the taskRoleArn parameter

---

## 1. In Simple English

You want a specific ECS **task** to write to DynamoDB — not the entire EC2 instance or all tasks. The best way to do that in ECS is to use the **`taskRoleArn`**, which assigns IAM permissions at the **task level**, following the principle of **least privilege**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **`taskRoleArn`** enables containers to assume an IAM role that grants app-level permissions (e.g., DynamoDB, S3, Secrets Manager).
- **taskRoleArn** is passed in the **task definition**, not to the instance or service.
- This approach is aligned with **least privilege** and avoids the need to expose broader access to all tasks on the host.
- The **execution role** (`executionRoleArn`) is only used for ECS operations like pulling images and pushing logs — **not** for app logic.
- Always prefer **task roles** over **instance roles** when running multiple tasks on shared ECS infrastructure to ensure **security isolation**.

## Question 'SAA-Q041'

An Amazon RDS Read Replica is being deployed in a separate region. The master database is **not encrypted** but **all data in the new region must be encrypted**.

**How can this be achieved?**

- Enable encryption on the master DB instance, then create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica
- Encrypt a snapshot from the master DB instance, create a new encrypted master DB instance, and then create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica
- Encrypt a snapshot from the master DB instance, create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica from the snapshot
- Enable encryption using Key Management Service (KMS) when creating the cross-region Read Replica

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to move data from an **unencrypted** RDS master DB to a **new region**, but in that new region, all data must be **encrypted**.

Since **RDS Read Replicas inherit the encryption state of the master**, and **you cannot encrypt an unencrypted DB directly**, you must take a **snapshot**, encrypt it, and then create a **new encrypted master** from it. Only then can you create an encrypted cross-region Read Replica.

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- RDS **encryption cannot be enabled on existing unencrypted DBs**.
- To switch from unencrypted → encrypted, you must:
  1. Take a snapshot
  2. Encrypt the snapshot
  3. Restore a new DB from it
  4. Use that DB as the master for further operations

**Tip:** If the word **"unencrypted"** appears in the question, look for a **snapshot-based workaround**, not direct encryption.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **RDS encryption is immutable** — if a DB is created unencrypted, you **must restore from an encrypted snapshot** to get an encrypted version.
- You **cannot change** an existing RDS instance’s encryption state after it’s been launched.
- **Encrypted Read Replicas** require the **source DB to also be encrypted**.
- This multi-step process is commonly required in cross-region, compliance-driven architectures (e.g., for regulatory or data sovereignty reasons).
- AWS KMS allows you to choose or bring your own key (BYOK) when encrypting the snapshot.

## Question 'SAA-Q042'

A company has uploaded some highly critical data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Management are concerned about **data availability** and require that steps be taken to **protect the data from accidental deletion**.

The data should **still be accessible**, and a user should be able to **delete the data intentionally**.

**Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to accomplish this? (Select TWO.)**

- Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket
- Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket
- Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket
- Enable versioning on the S3 bucket
- Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket

---

## 1. In Simple English

Management wants to prevent **accidental deletion** of critical S3 objects, but **intentional deletes** should still be possible. The right solution is to:

- Enable **versioning**, so even if a user deletes a file, previous versions are retained.
- Enable **MFA Delete**, which requires multi-factor authentication to permanently delete data or versions — protecting against accidents.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Versioning** stores all versions of objects, including deleted or overwritten ones. You can roll back accidental deletes or changes.
- **MFA Delete** requires an MFA token to delete object versions or suspend versioning — adding a layer of admin-level control.
- Together, these features ensure that **accidental deletes don’t result in data loss**, while **intentional deletes** can still be done securely.
- **MFA Delete** must be enabled via **CLI** or **API** — it cannot be enabled in the AWS Management Console.
- These tools are especially relevant for **compliance-heavy** or **mission-critical** datasets.

## Question 'SAA-Q043'

A company hosts an application on Amazon EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers in several AWS Regions. **Distribution rights** for the content require that users in different **geographies** must be served content from **specific regions**.

**Which configuration meets these requirements?**

- Configure Application Load Balancers with multi-Region routing
- Create Amazon Route 53 records with a geolocation routing policy
- Create Amazon Route 53 records with a geoproximity routing policy
- Configure Amazon CloudFront with multiple origins and AWS WAF

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company has rules about **who can access content from where**, so users in **certain countries or regions must be served from specific AWS Regions**. This is a **geography-based routing** problem, and the best way to solve it is using **Route 53 geolocation routing**, which directs traffic based on the user’s location.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Geolocation routing** makes DNS decisions based on the **user’s location**, such as country or continent. It’s deterministic and great for licensing or data sovereignty.
- **Geoproximity routing** uses **location of AWS resources** and **traffic bias** settings, but may not guarantee geographic isolation.
- **Application Load Balancers** are regional and cannot route globally — they need a **DNS layer** (e.g., Route 53) for global redirection.
- **CloudFront** caches and accelerates content globally, but does **not natively enforce regional compliance or routing logic**.
- Use **Route 53 geolocation + ALBs in each Region** to meet global content delivery laws or contractual obligations.

## Question 'SAA-Q044'

An application is being created that will use Amazon EC2 instances to **generate and store data**. Another set of EC2 instances will then **analyze and modify the data**. Storage requirements will be **significant and will continue to grow over time**. The application architects require a storage solution.

**Which actions would meet these needs?**

- Store the data in an Amazon EBS volume. Mount the EBS volume on the application instances
- Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier. Update the vault policy to allow access to the application instances
- Store the data in an Amazon EFS file system. Mount the file system on the application instances
- Store the data in AWS Storage Gateway. Set up AWS Direct Connect between the Gateway appliance and the EC2 instances

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app generates and modifies large volumes of data using **multiple EC2 instances**. The best solution is to use a **shared, scalable file system** that all instances can access simultaneously — this is exactly what **Amazon EFS** is designed for.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- If multiple EC2 instances **read/write** data simultaneously and storage must **scale automatically**, think **EFS**.
- If data is cold or infrequently accessed, consider **Glacier** or **S3**.
- If access is single-instance and high-performance, **EBS** might be okay.

**Tip:** Look for keywords like **shared**, **growing**, and **concurrent access** — these often point to EFS.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Amazon EFS** (Elastic File System) is a serverless, NFS-based storage service that grows and shrinks automatically.
- It’s ideal when you need **shared file access**, such as **microservices**, **big data workloads**, or **web applications**.
- Supports **thousands of concurrent connections**, and integrates with **EC2 Auto Scaling**, **Lambda**, and **EKS**.
- Unlike **EBS**, which requires manual resizing and single-instance attachment (per AZ), EFS offers true elasticity and multi-instance support.
- **Glacier** should be used **only** for data that you rarely access — not for active or growing workloads.
- **Storage Gateway** is optimized for **hybrid cloud** deployments and is unnecessary for fully cloud-native applications like this.

## Question 'SAA-Q045'

A company uses an Amazon RDS MySQL database instance to store customer order data. The security team has requested that **SSL/TLS encryption in transit** must be used for encrypting connections to the database from application servers. The data in the database is **already encrypted at rest** using an AWS KMS key.

**How can a Solutions Architect enable encryption in transit?**

- Download the AWS-provided root certificates. Use the certificates when connecting to the RDS DB instance.
- Enable encryption in transit using the RDS Management console and obtain a key using AWS KMS.
- Add a self-signed certificate to the RDS DB instance. Use the certificates in all connections to the RDS DB instance.
- Take a snapshot of the RDS instance. Restore the snapshot to a new instance with encryption in transit enabled.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company already has **encryption at rest** using KMS. Now they want to **encrypt network connections to RDS** — that is, **encryption in transit**. The correct method is to **download AWS’s RDS SSL certificate** and use it when establishing a connection to the database.

| **Download AWS root certificates**              | ✅ Correct   | AWS RDS supports SSL/TLS out of the box. Clients must download and use the AWS RDS root certificate when initiating encrypted connections. |
| **Enable via console with KMS**                 | ❌ Incorrect | KMS is for encryption at rest, not in transit. RDS does not have a toggle to "enable" in-transit encryption via the console.               |
| **Self-signed certificate**                     | ❌ Incorrect | You cannot upload or manage custom certificates for RDS MySQL — AWS provides the trusted certs.                                            |
| **Restore snapshot with encryption in transit** | ❌ Incorrect | Encryption in transit is a client-side behavior — not something configured during snapshot restore.                                        |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Determine whether the question is asking about **encryption at rest** (use KMS, snapshot restore) or **in transit** (SSL/TLS).
- If it's about **in transit**, AWS usually handles the server side — the client must initiate an SSL connection using a **trusted certificate**.

**Tip:** Look for **keywords like “SSL”, “TLS”, or “network connection”** — these usually hint at client-side configuration using AWS-provided certs.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- Amazon RDS **already supports SSL/TLS** for connections — no extra setup is needed server-side.
- What’s required is to **download the AWS RDS root certificate** and ensure your client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, app code) uses it during connection.
- Encryption **at rest** and **in transit** are distinct and configured separately:
  - At rest = via **KMS**, configured when launching DB (not toggleable after).
  - In transit = via **SSL**, configured at the **client level**, not in the RDS console.
- This setup aligns with compliance frameworks (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA) requiring data encryption in transit.

## Question 'SAA-Q046'

A company plans to make an Amazon EC2 Linux instance **unavailable outside of business hours to save costs**. The instance is backed by an **Amazon EBS volume**. There is a requirement that the **contents of the instance’s memory must be preserved** when it is made unavailable.

**How can a solutions architect meet these requirements?**

- Terminate the instance outside business hours. Recover the instance again when required.
- Hibernate the instance outside business hours. Start the instance again when required.
- Stop the instance outside business hours. Start the instance again when required.
- Use Auto Scaling to scale down the instance outside of business hours. Scale up the instance when required.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants to **save money by shutting down the EC2 instance** after hours but still **keep everything in memory (RAM)** for quick recovery. The only AWS feature that preserves RAM is **EC2 hibernation**.

| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Terminate the instance**  | ❌ Incorrect | Termination deletes the instance and all memory and ephemeral data. Even if the EBS volume is kept, the memory state is lost. |
| **Hibernate the instance**  | ✅ Correct   | Hibernate preserves memory (RAM), EBS root volume, and instance state. Great for fast recovery.                               |
| **Stop the instance**       | ❌ Incorrect | Stopping only preserves disk (EBS) state — not memory. The OS and apps would restart from scratch.                            |
| **Auto Scaling scale-down** | ❌ Incorrect | Auto Scaling is for managing fleets, not individual instance memory or business-hour shutdowns.                               |

**Strategy:**  
When a question mentions **“preserve memory”**, always look for **EC2 hibernation**.  
If the goal is just cost savings (and memory doesn't matter), then stopping is usually sufficient.

**Tip:** Hibernation is only available if:

- The instance is **EBS-backed**
- **Hibernation is enabled** in the AMI/launch settings
- **RAM is ≤150 GB** (limits apply)

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **EC2 Hibernation** saves the contents of RAM to the root EBS volume when the instance is hibernated. When restarted, the instance resumes **exactly where it left off**, including OS, application state, and in-memory caches.
- Hibernation is ideal for **development environments**, **test servers**, or **long-running apps** that need fast resume times without reinitializing state.
- You must **enable hibernation at launch**, and only certain **instance types and AMIs** support it.
- **Stopping** is faster to configure but does **not** retain memory — the OS starts fresh upon reboot.
- Use **monitoring and automation** (e.g., CloudWatch + Lambda) to automatically hibernate or resume instances based on time-of-day or usage.

## Question 'SAA-Q047'

A surveying team is using a fleet of drones to collect images of construction sites. The surveying team’s laptops lack the inbuilt storage and compute capacity to transfer the images and process the data. While the team has Amazon EC2 instances for processing and Amazon S3 buckets for storage, **network connectivity is intermittent and unreliable**.

**What should a solutions architect recommend?**

- During intermittent connectivity to EC2 instances, upload images to Amazon SQS.
- Process and store the images using AWS Snowball Edge devices.
- Cache the images locally on a hardware appliance pre-installed with AWS Storage Gateway to process the images when connectivity is restored.
- Configure Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to create multiple delivery streams aimed separately at the S3 buckets for storage and the EC2 instances for processing the images.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The drones capture lots of images, but the laptops can't handle storage or processing. The company already uses EC2 and S3, but since the **network is unreliable**, the team needs a **local solution** that can both **store and process data offline** — this is exactly what **AWS Snowball Edge** is designed for.

## Question 'SAA-Q048'

A company wishes to **restrict access to their Amazon DynamoDB table** to specific, **private source IP addresses from their VPC**.

**What should be done to secure access to the table?**

- Create the Amazon DynamoDB table in the VPC
- Create a gateway VPC endpoint and add an entry to the route table
- Create an interface VPC endpoint in the VPC with an Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
- Create an AWS VPN connection to the Amazon DynamoDB endpoint

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company wants only **internal traffic from their own VPC's private IPs** to be able to access DynamoDB. The best way to enforce this is to use a **VPC endpoint** for DynamoDB and apply security controls to that endpoint.

## Question 'SAA-Q051'

A developer created an application that uses Amazon EC2 and an Amazon RDS MySQL database instance. The developer stored the database user name and password in a configuration file on the root EBS volume of the EC2 application instance. A Solutions Architect has been asked to design a more secure solution.

**What should the Solutions Architect do to achieve this requirement?**

- Install an Amazon-trusted root certificate on the application instance and use SSL/TLS encrypted connections to the database.
- Create an IAM role with permission to access the database. Attach this IAM role to the EC2 instance.
- Attach an additional volume to the EC2 instance with encryption enabled. Move the configuration file to the encrypted volume.
- Move the configuration file to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an IAM role with permission to the bucket and attach it to the EC2 instance.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The current setup stores database credentials insecurely on the EC2 root volume. The architect needs a solution that avoids storing static credentials altogether, improving security.

| Simplify audit and security policies | ✅ Use IAM and CloudTrail        |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **IAM Database Authentication** allows applications to connect to RDS (MySQL or PostgreSQL) using **temporary tokens** from AWS STS instead of passwords.
- This eliminates the need to store DB credentials in config files, S3, or EBS volumes.
- The EC2 instance assumes an IAM role, and the AWS SDK uses the instance metadata service to retrieve temporary credentials for database access.
- This approach enhances security, reduces operational burden, and aligns with AWS’s principle of least privilege and secure-by-default practices.
- While using encryption (EBS, SSL/TLS) is important, it does **not** replace the need to eliminate static secrets.

### Question 'SAA-Q052'

An eCommerce application consists of three tiers. The web tier includes EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer, the middle tier uses EC2 instances and an Amazon SQS queue to process orders, and the database tier consists of an Auto Scaling DynamoDB table. During busy periods customers have complained about delays in the processing of orders. A Solutions Architect has been tasked with reducing processing times.

**Which action will be MOST effective in accomplishing this requirement?**

- Replace the Amazon SQS queue with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
- Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution with a custom origin to cache the responses for the web tier.
- Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to scale out the middle tier instances based on the SQS queue depth.
- Use Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) in front of the DynamoDB backend tier.

| **Replace the Amazon SQS queue with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.**                                     | ❌ Incorrect | Kinesis Data Firehose is a data ingestion and delivery service, not suitable for decoupled job processing like SQS. It’s not designed for task distribution to EC2 worker nodes. |
| **Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution with a custom origin to cache the responses for the web tier.** | ❌ Incorrect | CloudFront improves content delivery speed, but does nothing for order processing logic which happens after user input is received.                                              |
| **Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to scale out the middle tier instances based on the SQS queue depth.**    | ✅ Correct   | Scaling EC2 workers in response to SQS queue depth is the best way to keep up with high order volume. This directly reduces processing delays during traffic spikes.             |
| **Use Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) in front of the DynamoDB backend tier.**                        | ❌ Incorrect | DAX improves **read** performance, but order processing is likely **write-intensive**. DAX would have minimal effect on reducing processing latency for writes.                  |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

When facing a performance issue:

- **Trace the path of the request**—which layer is the bottleneck?
- **Use metric-driven scaling**—services like SQS support metrics like queue depth, which are great triggers for Auto Scaling.
- **Match the tool to the job**—e.g., DAX helps reads, SQS helps decoupling and buffering tasks, EC2 handles compute.

**Tip**: SQS-based architecture is decoupled by nature—always look for scalable consumers (EC2, Lambda) to match the queue load.

| Factor             | Best Choice                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Problem            | Delayed order processing during load     |
| Affected layer     | Middle (EC2 worker + SQS)                |
| Most effective fix | Scale EC2 workers based on queue depth   |
| Alternatives       | Do not directly improve processing speed |
| Key AWS Services   | Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, SQS metrics     |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **SQS scaling integration**: You can set up EC2 Auto Scaling with CloudWatch metrics such as `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` from SQS. This helps EC2 workers scale as queue backlog grows.
- **Kinesis vs. SQS**: Kinesis is optimized for streaming analytics (e.g., ingesting logs or clickstreams) whereas SQS is designed for decoupling producers and consumers in an application architecture.
- **DynamoDB Write Capacity**: Auto Scaling helps with spikes, but won’t help if the delay is before the database layer.
- **Latency troubleshooting**: Always isolate the source—processing delay ≠ data delay ≠ delivery delay.

### Question 'SAA-Q053'

A web application runs in public and private subnets. The application architecture consists of a web tier and database tier running on Amazon EC2 instances. Both tiers run in a single Availability Zone (AZ).

**Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to provide high availability for this architecture? (Select TWO.)**

- Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer (ALB) spanning multiple AZs
- Create new public and private subnets in the same VPC, each in a new AZ. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployment
- Create new public and private subnets in the same AZ for high availability
- Add the existing web application instances to an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Create new public and private subnets in a new AZ. Create a database using Amazon EC2 in one AZ

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app is hosted on EC2 instances in just one Availability Zone. That’s risky because if that AZ fails, the app goes down. You need to redesign it to survive outages. Which two actions will make the architecture highly available?

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answers:**

- **Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer (ALB) spanning multiple AZs**
- **Create new public and private subnets in the same VPC, each in a new AZ. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployment**

| **Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer (ALB) spanning multiple AZs**                                  | ✅ Correct   | Ensures web tier can run in multiple AZs and balance load or failover if one AZ fails. Auto Scaling group adds elasticity and fault tolerance.   |
| **Create new public and private subnets in the same VPC, each in a new AZ. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployment** | ✅ Correct   | Moving the DB to RDS Multi-AZ makes it fault-tolerant with automatic failover. Subnets in multiple AZs enable distributing resources across AZs. |
| **Create new public and private subnets in the same AZ for high availability**                                                         | ❌ Incorrect | Staying in one AZ defeats the purpose of high availability. You need to span **multiple** AZs for HA.                                            |
| **Add the existing web application instances to an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**                      | ❌ Incorrect | While ALB + ASG is good, it must span multiple AZs. This option implies keeping current single-AZ setup.                                         |
| **Create new public and private subnets in a new AZ. Create a database using Amazon EC2 in one AZ**                                    | ❌ Incorrect | EC2-based DB in one AZ is not HA. You’d need replication and failover logic; RDS handles this better natively.                                   |

---

## 5. Final Answer

- **Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer (ALB) spanning multiple AZs**
- **Create new public and private subnets in the same VPC, each in a new AZ. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployment**

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Prioritize AZ separation**: HA means surviving AZ failures—not just running replicas.
- **Use managed services**: Where available (like RDS Multi-AZ), let AWS handle HA for you.
- **Don’t assume subnets = redundancy**: It only matters if subnets are in _different_ AZs.
- **Think end-to-end**: Both the web and database tiers must be fault-tolerant.

**Tip**: Multi-AZ ≠ Multi-region. The question tests intra-region HA using AZs—not DR.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **RDS Multi-AZ vs Read Replicas**: Multi-AZ is for availability/failover; read replicas are for read scaling, not HA.
- **Auto Scaling & Health Checks**: Auto Scaling works best when combined with ALB health checks to terminate and replace unhealthy instances.
- **Why not EC2-hosted DB for HA?** You’d need to implement your own replication, backup, and failover logic—RDS simplifies all that.
- **Subnet creation**: Always match AZ placement when designing for fault tolerance; one subnet per AZ per tier is a common best practice.

### Question 'SAA-Q054'

A company needs to connect its on-premises data center network to a new virtual private cloud (VPC). There is a symmetrical internet connection of 100 Mbps in the data center network. The data transfer rate for an on-premises application is multiple gigabytes per day. Processing will be done using an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream.

**What should a solutions architect recommend for maximum performance?**

- Kinesis Data Firehose can be connected to the VPC using AWS PrivateLink. Install a 1 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS. To send data from on-premises to Kinesis Data Firehose, use the PrivateLink endpoint.
- Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between the on-premises network and the VPC. Set up BGP routing between the customer gateway and the virtual private gateway. Send data to Kinesis Data Firehose using a VPN connection.
- Get an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Data must be copied to the device after several days and shipped to AWS for expedited transfer to Kinesis Data Firehose. Repeat as necessary.
- Establish a peering connection between the on-premises network and the VPC. Configure routing for the on-premises network to use the VPC peering connection.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **PrivateLink + Firehose**: Firehose exposes a VPC endpoint service you can connect to via PrivateLink, avoiding public exposure and NAT dependency.
- **Direct Connect vs VPN**: Direct Connect bypasses the public internet entirely, giving you **predictable** performance and lower latency.
- **Snowball for hybrid?** Not suitable when ingestion is daily and continuous—it’s for batch archival or migration.
- **VPC Peering Use Case**: Designed for **intra-cloud** VPC communication, not for hybrid (on-premises) integration.

✅ **Correct Answer: <br> On-Demand Capacity Reservations**

| Option                              | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-Demand Capacity Reservations** | ✅ Correct   | Guarantees capacity in a specific AZ for specified instance types—ideal for scheduled jobs that must not be interrupted. It ensures the EC2 instances will be available when needed, even during high-demand periods. |
| **Regional Reserved Instances**     | ❌ Incorrect | Provides cost savings across the region, but does **not** reserve capacity. You could still be denied instances if none are available.                                                                                |
| **Savings Plans**                   | ❌ Incorrect | These lower your compute bill if you commit to a usage pattern, but don’t guarantee capacity availability.                                                                                                            |
| **On-Demand Instances**             | ❌ Incorrect | No commitment or reservation—you're at risk of not getting capacity during high-traffic windows.                                                                                                                      |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Separate capacity from pricing**: Capacity Reservations = availability. RIs/Savings Plans = billing discounts.
- **Watch for time-sensitive or uninterruptible workloads**: These require **guaranteed capacity**, not just pricing benefits.
- **Think scheduled vs bursty**: If the system runs on a consistent schedule, it’s a good candidate for reservation-based planning.

**Tip**: If the job **must run**, reserve the capacity. If the job **should be cheaper**, use RIs or Savings Plans.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Capacity Reservations vs RIs**: RIs are for saving money, while Capacity Reservations are for guaranteeing that your EC2 instances will be available when you launch them.
- **Can you combine RIs with Capacity Reservations?** Yes! You can create a zonal RI, which also reserves capacity and gets a discount.
- **Savings Plans** offer the most flexibility across EC2, Fargate, and Lambda, but don’t help you if there’s a capacity shortage in an AZ.
- **Critical workload strategy**: For time-critical workloads (e.g., analytics jobs, financial reporting), **availability trumps cost**—so reserve early.

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket as its origin** | ✅ Correct   | CloudFront is AWS's content delivery network (CDN). It caches content in edge locations around the world, reducing latency for global users accessing static files stored in S3. |
| **Use cross-Region replication to all Regions**            | ❌ Incorrect | Replication just copies data to multiple regions, but doesn't provide caching or latency reduction. It's useful for backup or compliance—not content delivery.                   |
| **Use the geoproximity feature of Amazon Route 53**        | ❌ Incorrect | Geoproximity helps route users to resources based on location, but doesn't cache or speed up content. It’s for traffic control—not content acceleration.                         |
| **Generate presigned URLs for the files**                  | ❌ Incorrect | Presigned URLs control access to private objects. This doesn't help with performance or global distribution. Also unnecessary if content is public.                              |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Why CloudFront?**  
  It reduces latency, handles caching, and offloads traffic from S3 for scalable delivery. You also get benefits like HTTPS support, DDoS protection (via AWS Shield), and global edge locations.

- **Public static content pattern**:  
  A popular design for static websites is:

  - Store content in S3 (public or restricted)
  - Distribute globally using CloudFront
  - Optionally integrate with Route 53 for custom domains

- **Latency vs Redundancy**:  
  Just replicating data (as with CRR) doesn’t help latency—it only increases durability or regional availability.

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spot Instances      | ❗ Tempting for cost savings, but unreliable for **uninterrupted** use                   |
| Reserved Instances  | ⚠️ Might look cost-efficient, but wasteful due to infrequency of use                     |
| Dedicated Instances | ❌ Irrelevant; more secure, not cheaper                                                  |
| On-Demand Instances | ✅ Obvious but correct — ideal balance of flexibility and reliability for infrequent use |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Frequency is key**: If usage is low and not sustained, RIs and Savings Plans may not help.
- **Reliability matters**: If a job _must not be interrupted_, **never choose Spot**.
- **Watch for keywords**: “Uninterrupted” or “mission-critical” rules out Spot Instances instantly.

**Tip**: If it’s **infrequent and non-interruptible**, On-Demand is usually the safest and most appropriate.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Spot Instance suitability**: Best for jobs that can be restarted or checkpointed—e.g., CI pipelines, parallel computing with retries.
- **RIs and commitment risk**: Committing to a Reserved Instance for a job that runs only 5 days every quarter leads to wasted spend.
- **On-Demand as default**: It’s your go-to for infrequent, short-term jobs where availability and control are critical.
- **Savings Plans?** Not listed as an option here, but even then, it wouldn’t fit unless job duration and frequency increased.

### Question 'SAA-Q058'

A website runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), which serves as an origin for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. An AWS WAF is being used to protect against SQL injection attacks. A review of security logs revealed an external malicious IP that needs to be blocked from accessing the website.

**What should a solutions architect do to protect the application?**

- Modify the network ACL on the CloudFront distribution to add a deny rule for the malicious IP address
- Modify the security groups for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address
- Modify the network ACL for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address
- Modify the configuration of AWS WAF to add an IP match condition to block the malicious IP address

---

## 1. In Simple English

A website uses CloudFront + ALB + EC2. It’s already using AWS WAF to block bad behavior like SQL injection. Now, security logs show one malicious IP. What’s the best way to block that IP from accessing the website?

| **Modify the network ACL on the CloudFront distribution to add a deny rule for the malicious IP address**                 | ❌ Incorrect | There is **no such thing** as a network ACL on a CloudFront distribution. NACLs apply only to VPC subnets.                                           |
| **Modify the security groups for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address** | ❌ Incorrect | Security groups are **stateful allow-only** rules. You cannot **deny** specific IPs using security groups.                                           |
| **Modify the network ACL for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address**     | ❌ Incorrect | Network ACLs only apply at the subnet level in the VPC. Traffic from CloudFront comes from AWS IP ranges, so source IPs may be masked.               |
| **Modify the configuration of AWS WAF to add an IP match condition to block the malicious IP address**                    | ✅ Correct   | WAF sits in front of CloudFront and/or ALB and **can block IP addresses directly**. This is the **right layer** for blocking malicious IPs globally. |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Check where the traffic is intercepted**: If CloudFront or ALB is involved, think **WAF**.
- **Remember security group behavior**: They allow traffic, but **cannot deny**.
- **Block IPs at the right layer**: WAF is perfect for blocking specific IPs before traffic even hits your infrastructure.

**Tip**: For **layer 7** threats or IP-level filtering in a distributed setup, **WAF is your go-to tool**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **WAF is layer 7**: It can inspect and filter HTTP requests before they hit the backend.
- **IP Sets in WAF**: You can group malicious IPs into reusable IP sets for easier management.
- **NACL vs SG vs WAF**:
  - **Security Groups**: Stateful, allow-only, instance-level
  - **NACLs**: Stateless, allow/deny, subnet-level
  - **WAF**: HTTP-level filtering, global IP control
- **CloudFront and source IPs**: WAF works well with CloudFront because it sees the **actual client IP** in the `X-Forwarded-For` header and can act on it.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Minimum duration billing**:
  - Glacier Deep Archive: 180 days
  - S3 Standard-IA / One Zone-IA: 30 days
  - Intelligent-Tiering: 30 days
  - S3 Standard: **No minimum**
- **Access timing**:

  - Glacier classes are meant for months-to-years storage
  - Standard is great for short-lived, high-access workloads (like daily logs, temp files, job outputs)

- **Cost isn’t just about per GB**: It’s about matching duration and frequency to the storage class.

### Question 'SAA-Q060'

A persistent database must be migrated from an on-premises server to an Amazon EC2 instance. The database requires 64,000 IOPS and, if possible, should be stored on a single Amazon EBS volume.

**Which solution should a Solutions Architect recommend?**

- Create an Amazon EC2 instance with two Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes attached. Provision 32,000 IOPS per volume and create a logical volume using the OS that aggregates the capacity.
- Create an Amazon EC2 instance with four Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes attached. Max out the IOPS on each volume and use a RAID 0 stripe set.
- Create a Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instance with an Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volume attached. Provision 64,000 IOPS for the volume.
- Use an instance from the I3 I/O optimized family and leverage instance store storage to achieve the IOPS requirement.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Check for IOPS ceiling**: io1 volumes support up to 64K IOPS **on Nitro-based EC2 instances**.
- **Don’t default to RAID**: Only use RAID if a single volume cannot meet the need.
- **Instance store ≠ persistent**: Always check for “persistent” storage requirements.
- **Nitro unlocks limits**: Many high-performance storage limits depend on using a Nitro-backed instance.

**Tip**: If the question says “if possible, use a single volume,” try io1/io2 first before RAIDing multiple volumes.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Nitro EC2 advantage**: Nitro enables higher EBS throughput (e.g., up to 64K IOPS for a single io1 volume, depending on instance type).
- **io1 vs io2**: io2 offers better durability, but both support high IOPS provisioning.
- **gp3 alternative**: gp3 allows up to 16K IOPS and 1,000 MB/s throughput—far below 64K IOPS need here.
- **Why not instance store?** Instance store is **non-persistent**. If the instance fails or stops, data is gone.

### Question 'SAA-Q061'

A Solutions Architect has been tasked with re-deploying an application running on AWS to enable high availability. The application processes messages that are received in an ActiveMQ queue running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. Messages are then processed by a consumer application running on Amazon EC2. After processing the messages, the consumer application writes results to a MySQL database running on Amazon EC2.

**Which architecture offers the highest availability and low operational complexity?**

- Deploy a second Active MQ server to another Availability Zone. Launch an additional consumer EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. Use MySQL database replication to another Availability Zone.
- Deploy Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers configured across two Availability Zones. Launch an additional consumer EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. Use MySQL database replication to another Availability Zone.
- Deploy Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers configured across two Availability Zones. Create an Auto Scaling group for the consumer EC2 instances across two Availability Zones. Use an Amazon RDS MySQL database with Multi-AZ enabled.
- Deploy Amazon MQ with active/standby brokers configured across two Availability Zones. Launch an additional consumer EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ enabled.

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Match the OSI layer**: Layer 4 → NLB; Layer 7 → ALB.
- **Think in AZs**: One AZ = risk of outage. Multi-AZ = resilience.
- **Cost ≠ availability**: Right-sizing EC2s saves money but doesn't protect against failure.
- **Elasticity matters**: Auto Scaling handles dynamic loads and improves resource efficiency.

**Tip**: If you see "Layer 4" in the question, think **Network Load Balancer**.

### Question 'SAA-Q063'

An insurance company has a web application that serves users in the United Kingdom and Australia. The application includes a database tier using a MySQL database hosted in `eu-west-2`. The web tier runs from `eu-west-2` and `ap-southeast-2`. Amazon Route 53 geoproximity routing is used to direct users to the closest web tier. It has been noted that Australian users receive **slow response times to queries**.

**Which changes should be made to the database tier to improve performance?**

- Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora global database in MySQL compatibility mode. Configure read replicas in `ap-southeast-2`
- Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB. Use DynamoDB global tables to enable replication to additional Regions
- Deploy MySQL instances in each Region. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in front of MySQL to reduce the load on the primary instance
- Migrate the database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. Configure Multi-AZ in the Australian Region

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app is hosted in both the UK and Australia, but the **database is only in the UK**, causing slow queries for **Australian users**. What's the best way to speed things up for those users?

| **Aurora global DB with read replicas in Australia** | ✅ Correct   | Aurora global databases support cross-region replication and allow **Australian users to read from local replicas**, reducing query latency. Writes still go to the primary, but reads are local. |
| **DynamoDB global tables**                           | ❌ Incorrect | DynamoDB is NoSQL. You cannot simply migrate a relational MySQL schema. Also, this is a **major redesign**, not a performance fix.                                                                |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **VPC to VPC in AWS?** → Use **VPC Peering** (or Transit Gateway for more complex setups).
- **No bandwidth caps or SPOFs?** → Peering is non-throttled and uses AWS backbone.
- **Endpoints ≠ routing**: Gateway endpoints are for AWS service access only.

**Tip**: When asked to link two VPCs securely and directly within AWS, think **VPC Peering** first—unless you need to scale to hundreds of VPCs (then Transit Gateway is better).

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **VPC Peering** is:

  - **Non-transitive**: You must create explicit peering between each VPC pair.
  - **Secure**: Traffic flows through the AWS backbone.
  - **Scalable**: Up to 125 peering connections per VPC (soft limit).
  - **Cost-effective**: Only pay for data transfer, no additional service fees.

- **Transit Gateway** (not mentioned here) is ideal for **many VPCs**, but overkill for just two.

### Question 'SAA-Q065'

An Amazon S3 bucket in the `us-east-1` Region hosts the static website content of a company. The content is made available through an Amazon CloudFront origin pointing to that bucket. A second copy of the bucket is created in the `ap-southeast-1` Region using cross-region replication. The chief solutions architect wants a solution that provides **greater availability for the website**.

**Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to increase availability? (Select TWO.)**

- Set up failover routing in Amazon Route 53.
- Create an origin for CloudFront for both buckets.
- Point Amazon Route 53 to the replica bucket by creating a record.
- Add an origin for ap-southeast-1 to CloudFront.
- Using us-east-1 bucket as the primary bucket and ap-southeast-1 bucket as the secondary bucket, create a CloudFront origin group.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The website uses an S3 bucket and CloudFront in one region (`us-east-1`), and now there's a backup bucket in another region (`ap-southeast-1`). The company wants to make the website **more available** if the primary S3 bucket or region fails. What can they do to **use the backup bucket**?

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **CloudFront origin group failover**: CloudFront retries requests on the **secondary origin** if the primary fails based on HTTP status codes or connection errors.
- **Why not Route 53?** Route 53 failover requires health checks and only works at DNS level. With CloudFront in place, origin groups are faster and more resilient.
- **Cross-region replication** ensures both buckets are in sync—but replication alone doesn't help unless you enable access/failover mechanisms like origin groups.

### Question 'SAA-Q066'

A company wants to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing the AWS Management Console.

**Which IAM policy should a solutions architect implement to achieve this goal?**

- Allow all actions if MFA is enabled using a condition key.
- Use a service control policy (SCP) to force MFA per user.
- Assign MFA via EC2 metadata and attach to user roles.
- Attach a policy that denies all actions globally.

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: <br> Allow all actions if MFA is enabled using a condition key**

| Option                                                        | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allow all actions if MFA is enabled using a condition key** | ✅ Correct   | You can write IAM policies with `Condition: { "Bool": { "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true" } }` to allow actions **only if MFA is enabled**. This is the standard way to enforce MFA. |
| **Use a service control policy (SCP) to force MFA per user**  | ❌ Incorrect | SCPs apply at the **account or organizational unit level**—not directly at user level, and don’t override IAM user policies directly.                                                   |
| **Assign MFA via EC2 metadata and attach to user roles**      | ❌ Incorrect | EC2 instance metadata is unrelated to user MFA. This is entirely off-topic.                                                                                                             |
| **Attach a policy that denies all actions globally**          | ❌ Incorrect | Denying everything outright blocks access for all users, even those with MFA. Not a viable strategy unless carefully scoped (not mentioned here).                                       |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Look for `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`**: It’s the key to enforcing MFA in IAM policies.
- **Know SCP limits**: SCPs set guardrails at account/org level—not individual user policies.
- **Ignore EC2 in identity-focused questions**: Instance profiles ≠ IAM user access control.

**Tip**: Enforcing MFA is a **condition-based Allow**, not a blanket Deny.

- **Auto Scaling Groups** monitor the health of EC2 instances via EC2 status checks or Load Balancer health checks and automatically replace unhealthy instances.
- **Elastic IPs** are useful when you want a consistent IP, but **must be re-associated** manually unless scripted.
- **EBS** volumes can be re-attached to new instances after failure, but that’s a manual recovery step unless paired with automation.
- **User Data scripts** do nothing once the instance is running—they can’t detect or react to failures.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance profile**                            | ✅ Correct   | This allows the EC2 instance to assume the role and get **temporary credentials** automatically.       |
| **Create an IAM role with S3 access permissions**                              | ✅ Correct   | This defines **what actions** the EC2 instance is allowed to perform on S3.                            |
| **Embed the access keys in the EC2 user data script**                          | ❌ Incorrect | This would violate the policy—it uses static long-term credentials, and it's also insecure.            |
| **Generate access keys and store them in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** | ❌ Incorrect | Even though Parameter Store is secure, storing long-term access keys still violates the stated policy. |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **IAM roles** grant **temporary security credentials** through the EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS).
- **Instance profiles** are how roles are attached to EC2, making the credentials **automatically rotated** and managed by AWS.
- Storing **access keys in scripts or Parameter Store** not only increases risk but violates strict **no-static-credentials** policies.
- This is a foundational pattern for building **secure-by-default** cloud-native apps.

### Question 'SAA-Q073'

A financial application uses **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**. The database experiences **periodic spikes in read traffic**, leading to **increased query response times**.

**Which solution should a solutions architect implement to improve read scalability without affecting write operations?**

- Enable Multi-AZ deployment for the RDS instance
- Create one or more Amazon RDS read replicas
- Use Amazon ElastiCache for caching queries
- Increase the DB instance size

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app’s database is slow **during read-heavy spikes**, but **writes must remain unaffected**. What’s the best way to **improve read performance only**, without changing how writes are handled?

### Question 'SAA-Q076'

An IAM user has both an **allow policy** granting access to a specific **S3 bucket** and a **deny policy** that restricts the **same access**.

**What is the resulting behavior when the user tries to access the S3 bucket?**

- Access is denied because the deny policy takes precedence.
- The user is allowed access due to the explicit allow.
- The IAM user will receive partial access to the bucket.
- Access is granted only during certain time conditions.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Multi-AZ RDS** maintains a **standby replica** in a different AZ using synchronous replication.
- During failure (e.g., instance or AZ outage), RDS performs an **automatic failover** to the standby.
- Unlike read replicas, **Multi-AZ standby is not used for reads**—it’s purely for high availability.
- Promoting a read replica **requires manual steps**, which can delay recovery.

### Question 'SAA-Q078'

A company is running a **web application in two Availability Zones** using **Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**. The company wants to ensure **fault tolerance** and **zero downtime deployments during updates**.

**Which actions should the solutions architect recommend?**  
(Choose TWO)

- Use target groups and implement blue/green deployment using weighted target groups.
- Deploy EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones.
- Use a single AZ with a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and set deregistration delay to zero.
- Deploy the application on AWS Lambda to avoid using load balancers.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app runs on EC2 in two zones behind an ALB. They want to make sure it never goes down — even during app updates. What can help with **smooth, zero-downtime deployments** and **survive AZ failures**?

| --------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable throttling and rate limits**         | ✅ Correct   | API Gateway supports **built-in throttling** at both **method** and **stage** level. This helps prevent burst abuse while allowing genuine requests to pass through. |
| **Implement a WAF rule to block IPs**         | ❌ Incorrect | WAF blocking is reactive and requires specific patterns or IPs. It’s not effective for **short bursts** or **dynamic sources** unless there’s a known abuse pattern. |
| **Increase Lambda concurrency**               | ❌ Incorrect | Helps with processing capacity but does **not prevent abusive traffic** hitting the API itself. Doesn’t address the root concern.                                    |
| **Use CloudFront to cache dynamic responses** | ❌ Incorrect | Dynamic API responses (e.g., per user/session) typically **aren’t cacheable**. This won’t help with abuse or bursts.                                                 |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- When abuse prevention is needed, **control the entry point first**, not the backend.
- Use **rate limits and quotas** in API Gateway to:
  - Define **burst limits** (e.g., 1000 RPS)
  - Define **steady-state rates** (e.g., 500 RPS)
- Use **WAF** only if IP-based filtering or known attack patterns exist.

### Question 'SAA-Q082'

A **startup is storing logs in Amazon S3**. Logs are:

- **Frequently accessed** for the **first 30 days**
- **Infrequently accessed** for the **next 60 days**
- **Retained for 1 year**

The company wants to **reduce storage costs** while **meeting these access and retention requirements**.

**Which lifecycle policy actions should a solutions architect recommend?** (Choose TWO)

- Transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days.
- Replicate logs to another S3 bucket in a different region.
- Enable S3 Versioning to manage object transitions.
- Transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 90 days.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The startup wants to **store logs cheaply**:

- People use them often in the first month,
- Then not much for 2 months,
- But logs must stay stored for **1 year**.

What **S3 lifecycle rules** help lower cost while keeping the data available?

### Question 'SAA-Q083'

An **IoT application** uses **Amazon DynamoDB** to store **temperature data from millions of devices**. The solutions architect notices **hot partitions** and **throttling during peak times**.

**What is the MOST effective way to improve write performance?**

- Enable DynamoDB Streams and increase read capacity units (RCUs).
- Use a composite primary key with a randomized suffix in the partition key.
- Disable Auto Scaling and manually provision high write capacity.
- Switch to strong consistency for all read operations.

---

## 1. In Simple English

The app is writing a lot of temperature data into DynamoDB.  
Too many writes are going to **just a few partitions**, which causes slowdowns and errors.  
How can we **spread out the writes better** so the database performs well?

| Option             | Trickiness                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| RCUs & Streams     | ⚠️ Misleading, as this affects **reads**, not writes      |
| Randomized suffix  | ✅ Easy to miss without understanding partitioning        |
| Manual capacity    | ❌ Sounds helpful, but doesn’t solve partition contention |
| Strong consistency | ❌ Distracts by focusing on reads, not writes             |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- Look for **DynamoDB write patterns**: Are they hitting the same partition key? That causes hot partitions.
- Use **randomization or sharding** techniques in keys to spread load.
- Know that **RCUs and consistency** are for **read performance**, not writes.

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Composite Key + Random Suffix | ✅ Yes                     | Spreads writes across multiple partitions        |
| Manual WCU Provisioning       | ❌ No                      | Doesn’t fix data skew                            |
| Strong Consistency Reads      | ❌ No                      | Affects only read latency                        |
| Streams + RCUs                | ❌ No                      | For change tracking and reads, not write scaling |

## 10. Summary Table (Conclusion)

| Problem        | Root Cause                  | Recommended Solution                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Hot Partitions | Too many writes to same key | Add random suffix to spread data          |
| Throttling     | Partition bottleneck        | Design better keys, not just add capacity |

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **DynamoDB partitions** are managed behind the scenes based on partition key values.
- If a single key gets **too much traffic**, it becomes a **hot partition**, leading to throttling.
- Best practices include:
  - **Randomizing keys**
  - **Sharding based on time or device ID**
  - Using **composite primary keys** to increase entropy
- Auto Scaling or adding RCUs won't help **if key design is flawed**.

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- Ask yourself: **Does the option eliminate single points of failure?**
- Know the strengths:
  - **Direct Connect** = high throughput, low latency, **but expensive** and not inherently redundant
  - **VPN** = easy and redundant (with two tunnels) but **less performant**
- Combine both for **cost-effective resilience**

category: "Design Secure Architectures"
tags: ["saa-c03", "iam-policy", "s3-deleteobject", "least-privilege", "iam"]

---

### Question 'SAA-Q087'

A **development team** requires permissions to **list an S3 bucket** and **delete objects** from that bucket.  
A **systems administrator** has created the following **IAM policy** and applied it to the group, but the group is **not able to delete objects**.

The company follows the **principle of least privilege**.

**Which statement should a solutions architect add to the policy to address this issue?**

- `{"Action":["s3:*"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"],"Effect":"Allow"}`
- `{"Action":["s3:DeleteObject"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket*"],"Effect":"Allow"}`
- `{"Action":["s3:DeleteObject"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"],"Effect":"Allow"}`
- `{"Action":["s3:*Object"],"Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"],"Effect":"Allow"}`

---

## 1. In Simple English

The team can’t **delete objects** from the S3 bucket even though the policy allows **list actions**.  
You need to **add the correct policy statement** so they can delete objects in the **right bucket** — without giving broader permissions.

---

### Question 'SAA-Q088'

The **engineering team** at a **Spanish football club** built a **notification system** using **Amazon SNS** to trigger **Lambda functions** for end-user delivery.

- During **off-season**, the system handles ~100 requests/sec.
- During **peak season**, this spikes to **5000 requests/sec**, and **some notifications are not delivered**.

**What is the BEST solution to ensure reliable delivery of notifications?**

- **Amazon SNS message deliveries to AWS Lambda have crossed the account concurrency quota for Lambda, so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit**
- **The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the SNS service**
- **Amazon SNS has hit a scalability limit, so the team needs to contact AWS support to raise the account limit**
- **The engineering team needs to provision more servers running the Lambda service**

---

## 1. In Simple English

Notifications are being lost when traffic increases.  
What’s causing this drop — SNS or Lambda?  
And what’s the right way to fix it?

| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Raise Lambda concurrency limit** | ✅ Correct   | Lambda has a **regional concurrency limit**. At 5000/sec, if concurrency is breached, invocations are throttled or dropped. |
| **Provision more SNS servers**     | ❌ Incorrect | SNS is **fully managed and serverless** — users cannot "provision servers" for it.                                          |
| **SNS scalability limit**          | ❌ Incorrect | SNS is highly scalable and not likely the bottleneck here.                                                                  |
| **Provision more Lambda servers**  | ❌ Incorrect | Lambda is serverless. Users **cannot manually provision** backend resources.                                                |

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

- **Always check concurrency limits for AWS Lambda** in high-throughput systems.
- Remember:
  - Lambda: **user-defined function**, auto-scales up to a **regional limit**
  - SNS: **high-throughput publisher** — unlikely to be the bottleneck
- Use **CloudWatch metrics** like `Throttles` to detect concurrency breaches.

**Which AWS services can help build a solution** for this requirement? (Select TWO)

- Use AWS Organizations
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication
- Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Use AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Use AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to get temporary security credentials

---

### Question 'SAA-Q090'

A technology blogger wants to write a review on the comparative pricing for various storage types available on AWS Cloud. The blogger has created a test file of size 1GB with some random data.

Next, he:

- Copies the file into **Amazon S3 Standard**
- Provisions a **100 GB EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)** volume and stores the file
- Copies the file into an **Amazon EFS Standard Storage** filesystem

At the end of the month, he reviews the bills for costs incurred by the 1GB file on each service.

**What is the correct order of the storage charges incurred for the test file?**

- Cost of test file storage on **S3 Standard < EFS < EBS**
- Cost of test file storage on **EFS < S3 Standard < EBS**
- Cost of test file storage on **EBS < S3 Standard < EFS**
- Cost of test file storage on **S3 Standard < EBS < EFS**

---

## 1. In Simple English

The question is asking: _Which AWS storage option costs the least to store 1 GB of data over a month?_

It compares **S3**, **EFS**, and **EBS**, and the trick is to account for the **minimum charges** or **provisioned capacity**.

### Question 'SAA-Q091'

A Big Data analytics company wants to set up an AWS cloud architecture that **throttles requests in case of sudden traffic spikes**.

**Which of the following services can be used to support this requirement?**

- Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS and AWS Lambda
- Elastic Load Balancer, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda
- Amazon Gateway Endpoints, Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis
- **Amazon API Gateway, Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis**

---

## 1. In Simple English

The company expects sudden surges in traffic and wants to control (or **throttle**) the flow of requests into its backend processing. The goal is to **buffer** incoming requests during spikes so that the system isn't overwhelmed.

### Question 'SAA-Q092'

A retail company has developed a REST API which stores user data in **DynamoDB** and static content in **S3**. **90% of read requests are for commonly accessed data**.

**What's the MOST efficient solution to improve performance?**

- Enable **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)** for DynamoDB and **CloudFront** for S3
- Enable **ElastiCache Redis** for DynamoDB and **ElastiCache Memcached** for S3
- Enable **DAX** for DynamoDB and **ElastiCache Memcached** for S3
- Enable **ElastiCache Redis** for DynamoDB and **CloudFront** for S3

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **S3 Transfer Acceleration** works best when clients are geographically distant from the bucket’s region.
- **Multipart uploads** allow you to upload parts in parallel, retry failed parts, and resume uploads if interrupted.
- The threshold for using multipart upload is typically **100 MB or more**.
- Transfer Acceleration may not help much if the client is near the S3 region — AWS provides a [speed comparison tool](https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html).
- Always monitor performance with **CloudWatch metrics** (`FirstByteLatency`, `BytesUploaded`) and **S3 access logs**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Transfer Acceleration** uses CloudFront edge locations to get your upload closer to the S3 bucket region faster — ideal for large files and remote offices.
- **Multipart uploads** allow simultaneous part uploads, which reduce time and recover better from network interruptions.
- While **Direct Connect** offers low latency and consistent bandwidth, it's more useful for sustained high-volume transfers or hybrid environments—not casual file uploads.
- **Global Accelerator** is intended for improving access to **application endpoints (ALB, NLB, EC2)** — not S3.
- Combining **Transfer Acceleration** and **multipart upload** can significantly reduce latency and increase reliability with minimal cost.

## Question 'SAA-Q097'

**Which AWS service provides an NFS interface to integrate on-premises data with AWS?**

- AWS Storage Gateway - Volume Gateway
- AWS Storage Gateway - File Gateway
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN
- AWS Storage Gateway - Tape Gateway

---

## 1. In Simple English

You're asked to pick the AWS service that lets your on-premises servers connect to AWS using the **NFS (Network File System)** protocol. This means mounting a remote file system just like a local one, with AWS on the backend.

| Site-to-Site VPN | ✅ Yes         | Sounds relevant due to networking, but it’s not about file access.    |
| Tape Gateway     | ✅ Yes         | Useful for backup, but unrelated to NFS or live file access.          |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions (Strategy + Tip)

**Strategy:**

- Look for the keyword **“NFS”** → this always implies file-level access.
- Eliminate anything related to **block storage (Volume Gateway)** or **virtual tapes (Tape Gateway)**.
- Be cautious with **networking services** (e.g., VPN) when the question is about **data access interfaces**.

**Tip:**  
When you see **NFS or SMB** in a hybrid storage question, your answer is almost certainly **AWS Storage Gateway – File Gateway**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **File Gateway** provides seamless NFS/SMB access to files stored in S3, appearing as mounted drives to on-premises applications.
- Can **cache frequently used files** locally for low-latency access.
- Supports **access-based enumeration**, **Active Directory integration**, and **eventual consistency** with S3.
- Great for hybrid architectures where some apps still require file systems but cloud storage is preferred for scalability and durability.
- Contrast with **Volume Gateway**, which is useful for legacy block-based apps that expect traditional hard drives.

**Strategy:**

- Identify whether the question is about **geography-based access control**.
- If yes, security groups are out — they don't know where the IP is from.
- Look for **WAF** or **CloudFront Geo Restriction** based on whether it's a VPC-hosted service or CDN.

**Tip:**  
**Geo blocking = AWS WAF or CloudFront**

- Use **WAF** for apps behind ALB or API Gateway.
- Use **CloudFront geo restrictions** for edge-optimized services.

| Geo-based access control | Only AWS WAF or CloudFront Geo Restriction can filter by country.             |
| WAF works with ALB       | Best choice when application is hosted inside a VPC.                          |
| Avoid                    | Security groups — IP only. CloudFront — not relevant for ALB/VPC-hosted apps. |

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **AWS WAF Geo Match conditions** let you define allow or deny rules based on the source country of the incoming request.
- WAF integrates with **ALB, API Gateway, App Runner**, and **CloudFront**.
- You can combine Geo Match with **rate limiting, IP reputation, and custom headers** for layered security.
- **Security groups** are great for IP address filtering but are blind to geolocation.
- **CloudFront geo restriction** only applies if you are serving static or cached content via the CDN — not for ALB-hosted dynamic apps in a VPC.

## Question 'SAA-Q099'

**How to recover from accidental deletion of a CMK used for S3 encryption?**

- Notify users about data loss
- Cancel the CMK deletion during the pending deletion period (7–30 days)
- The CMK can be recovered by the AWS root account user
- Contact AWS support to retrieve the CMK from their backup

---

## 1. In Simple English

You accidentally scheduled a customer managed key (CMK) for deletion, and it was used to encrypt S3 objects. How can you **stop the key from being deleted** before it’s gone forever?

---

## 2. Verbiage & Realism

| Aspect         | Assessment                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clarity        | Very clear — it’s about undoing an accidental CMK deletion.                    |
| Realism        | Highly realistic — CMK deletions can critically affect encrypted S3 data.      |
| Urgency        | Implied urgency, since data encrypted with a deleted key becomes inaccessible. |
| Trap Potential | High — several plausible but incorrect answers exist.                          |

## 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:**

- **Cancel the CMK deletion during the pending deletion period (7–30 days)**

| Option                                                                     | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                               |

| **Notify users about data loss**                                           | ❌ Incorrect | Premature — if within the deletion window, data loss is not yet certain.                                                                  |
| **Cancel the CMK deletion during the pending deletion period (7–30 days)** | ✅ Correct   | AWS KMS enforces a mandatory waiting period (minimum 7 days, up to 30). The deletion can be canceled during this time, restoring the key. |
| **The CMK can be recovered by the AWS root account user**                  | ❌ Incorrect | Even the root user cannot recover a CMK after the deletion window passes.                                                                 |
| **Contact AWS support to retrieve the CMK from their backup**              | ❌ Incorrect | AWS does not retain a backup of customer-managed keys due to security and ownership boundaries.                                           |

---

## 5. Final Answer

**Cancel the CMK deletion during the pending deletion period (7–30 days)**

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions (Strategy + Tip)

**Strategy:**

- Look for any **grace period or rollback mechanism** mentioned in AWS services (like CMK pending deletion).
- Understand what actions are **irreversible** and which ones can be reverted if caught early.

**Tip:**  
If a CMK is **scheduled for deletion**, **cancel it immediately** if it was a mistake — once the waiting period ends, **data is permanently lost**.

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Pending deletion is a protective delay** — designed to avoid accidental loss of access to encrypted data.
- You can **cancel deletion using the AWS Console, CLI (`cancel-key-deletion`), or SDKs**.
- CMKs protect sensitive data across services (e.g., S3, EBS, RDS); deleting them makes encrypted data permanently inaccessible.
- **Use tags or naming conventions** to mark critical CMKs and apply deletion protection policies or access controls.
- For disaster recovery, consider **key rotation**

| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Elastic IP address** | ❌ Incorrect | Elastic IPs are public IPv4 addresses. ALBs with IP target types **do not support public IPs**, only **private IPs from within the VPC**. |
| **Private IP address** | ✅ Correct   | Only private IP addresses (within the VPC CIDR or peered VPCs) are valid for ALB IP target groups.                                        |
| **Dynamic IP address** | ❌ Incorrect | “Dynamic IP” isn’t a valid configuration term here. ALB requires **static private IPs** within the VPC for IP-type targets.               |
| **Public IP address**  | ❌ Incorrect | ALB **does not support** public IPs in IP target groups; only **private** IP addresses are allowed.                                       |

| Private IP | Straightforward, correct.                                 |
| Dynamic IP | Misleading – no such term in ALB config context.          |
| Public IP  | High – common misconception since ALB is internet-facing. |

---

## 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**  
When you see ALB + IP target type, remember that only **private IPs inside the VPC** are valid. AWS does **not route traffic to public IPs** using internal load balancer mechanisms.

**Tip:**  
Always ask yourself: “Can this IP be routed inside the VPC via private network paths?” If not, it's invalid for ALB IP target groups.

---

## 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- ALBs support three target types: `instance`, `ip`, and `lambda`.
- When using `ip` type:
  - Must use **private IPs** in **CIDR blocks allowed by the VPC**.
  - IPs must be within the VPC, a peered VPC, or AWS Direct Connect/VPN-connected networks.
  - Targets can be **on-premises systems** if reachable via VPN/Direct Connect with **private addressing**.
