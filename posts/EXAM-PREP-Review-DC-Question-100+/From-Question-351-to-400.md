### üìò 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:

**Use a mix of On-Demand and Spot Instances with Auto Scaling groups**

| Option                                                                           | Verdict | Explanation                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Reserved Instances for all EC2 workloads to lock in low prices**           | ‚ùå      | Reserved Instances offer cost savings for **predictable, steady-state workloads** ‚Äî but not for fluctuating seasonal traffic. Also lacks flexibility.          |
| **Use On-Demand Instances across multiple Availability Zones with Auto Scaling** | ‚ö†Ô∏è      | While scalable and fault-tolerant, **On-Demand only** is the **most expensive** approach ‚Äî no cost optimization.                                               |
| **Use AWS Lambda for all backend services regardless of duration**               | ‚ùå      | Lambda is great for **short-lived, event-driven tasks** ‚Äî but using it **regardless of duration** could be **very costly** for long-running workloads.         |
| **Use a mix of On-Demand and Spot Instances with Auto Scaling groups**           | ‚úÖ      | Best answer. Spot instances can handle **non-critical, cost-sensitive workloads**, while On-Demand covers **baseline capacity** with Auto Scaling flexibility. |

---

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**:

- **Match pricing model to workload pattern**:

  - **Spot** = unpredictable, non-critical
  - **On-Demand** = base level capacity or short spikes
  - **Reserved** = consistent and predictable

- Use **Auto Scaling** to maintain elasticity
- Always look for **multi-AZ** when availability is a factor

### üß† 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy**:

- Know AWS's **placement group types**:

  - Spread: **max 7 per AZ**
  - Cluster: same AZ, low latency
  - Partition: used for big data workloads

- For Spread PGs, divide total instance count by 7 ‚Üí round up ‚Üí that‚Äôs your **AZ requirement**

**Tip**:
üëâ _‚ÄúSpread Placement Groups allow up to 7 EC2s per AZ. If you need 15 total, divide by 7 to plan AZ distribution.‚Äù_

  - Each instance is placed on **distinct hardware (rack)** for max fault isolation

- **Why Use Spread PG**:

  - Perfect for **sensitive workloads** where losing multiple EC2s at once is unacceptable

- **Design Tip**:

  - For more than 7 EC2s, **calculate required AZs by dividing instance count by 7**
  - Distribute across AZs as evenly as possible: e.g., 15 ‚Üí 7 + 7 + 1

### üìò 4. Answer and Explanation

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:

**None of the provided options are fully correct, but the closest AWS-aligned solution would be:**

> _Use Amazon Transcribe to convert audio files to text, and then use **Amazon Comprehend** to perform sentiment analysis. Optionally, visualize results using Amazon QuickSight._

However, **among the given options**, the **least incorrect one is:**

### üìö 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Kinesis Write Limits**:

  - Each shard supports:

    - **1 MB/sec or 1,000 records/sec** write throughput

  - Exceeding either limit leads to:
    ‚Üí `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`

- **Why Batch?**

  - Reduces total API calls
  - Each batch can contain **up to 500 records**
  - Efficient for mobile and IoT apps pushing high-frequency data

- **When to Increase Shards?**

  - After optimizing traffic (batching, partition key tuning)
  - For workloads that genuinely exceed shard capacity even after optimization

### üìö 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Enhanced Fan-Out (EFO)**:

  - Each registered consumer gets a **dedicated 2 MB/sec per shard**
  - Allows **multiple real-time applications** to process the same stream data without blocking each other
  - Reduces latency to **under 70ms** vs shared consumer latency (200ms+)
  - Requires **consumer registration** and incurs **additional cost**

- **When Not to Use EFO**:

  - If you have **only one consumer** or consumers read data sporadically, EFO might be overkill

- **When to Use Firehose Instead**:

  - If you just want to **load data into storage** (e.g., S3, Redshift) without building custom consumers

- Remember **who talks to whom** in 3-tier apps:

  - **ALB ‚Üí EC2**
  - **EC2 ‚Üí DB**

**Tip**:

- **Security Groups as Firewalls**:

  - You can **reference another SG** in the inbound rule of a DB to allow **only those instances** access
  - This ensures **tight control and auditability**

- **Why Not Use Subnet CIDRs?**

  - Too broad ‚Äî includes all instances in subnet (even future ones you didn‚Äôt intend to trust)

- **Default ASG Behavior**:

  - Uses **EC2 instance status** (e.g., system status checks)
  - Does **not act on ALB health check results** unless configured with ELB health check type

- **To Fix This**:

  - Set ASG‚Äôs health check type to `ELB` (which works with ALB)
  - That way, if ALB marks a target as unhealthy, ASG will terminate and replace it

  - Blocks malicious requests **at edge locations**, before they hit EC2
  - Scales globally, improves latency, and integrates well with **GeoMatch, IP blocklists**, etc.

- **WAF on ALB**:

  - Regional protection
  - Ideal for internal-facing apps, or if you don‚Äôt need CDN or edge caching

- **WAF and EC2**:

  - WAF **must sit in front of EC2**, not on EC2

### üìö 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **To use FIFO with S3 events**, the architecture must be:

  - **S3 ‚Üí EventBridge ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí FIFO SQS**
  - Or similar chain that inserts ordering logic

- **Why FIFO isn‚Äôt supported**:

  - S3 doesn‚Äôt guarantee **ordering**, which violates FIFO queue expectations

- **Best Practice**:

  - For simple eventing: stick with **Standard SQS**
  - For ordering or deduplication needs: use **EventBridge + FIFO queue**

  - Root volumes are **set to delete** when EC2 is terminated (default)
  - You can override this by unchecking **‚ÄúDelete on Termination‚Äù** in the EC2 launch settings

- **S3 vs EBS vs EFS**:

  - **EBS**: Block storage for a single instance at a time
  - **S3**: Object storage ‚Äî not a backup location unless you **snapshot**

| **What Was Asked**          | Best way to allow EC2 in private subnets to reach internet via IPv4          |
| **Correct Answer & Why**    | NAT Gateway in public subnet ‚Äî AWS-managed, designed for IPv4 private access |
| **Common Pitfall**          | Confusing Egress-Only IGW (IPv6 only) or putting IGWs in subnets             |
| **Documentation Reference** | NAT Gateway is purpose-built for this exact use case                         |
| **How to Avoid Mistake**    | Always match IPv4 with **NAT**, and keep it in **public subnet**             |

### üìö 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **NAT Gateway**:

  - Allows **IPv4-only private subnets** to **initiate outbound traffic** to the internet
  - Deployed in **public subnets** with route tables pointing from **private subnets to the NAT**
  - **Fully managed**: AWS handles failover (if configured in multiple AZs), scaling, and patching

- **Egress-Only Internet Gateway**:

  - Only for **IPv6**, used when outbound-only access is needed (similar to NAT Gateway for IPv6)
  - Will not help with any IPv4-based connectivity

- **NAT Instance**:

  - Custom EC2-based NAT
  - Requires **manual scaling, patching, routing, and high availability** setup

## ‚úÖ Correct Answers:

**Use WAF geo match statement listing the countries that you want to block**
**Use WAF IP set statement that specifies the IP addresses that you want to allow through**

| Option                                                                                                 | Verdict | Explanation                                                                                                                         |
