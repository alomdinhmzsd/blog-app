### 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:**

- **Enable Aurora Auto Scaling for read replicas**

| Option                                             | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable Aurora Auto Scaling for read replicas**   | ✅ Correct   | Aurora supports **Auto Scaling** of **read replicas** based on CPU/memory or connection metrics. This happens **transparently**, without changing how the application connects to the database. It helps absorb read traffic during peak periods while maintaining performance. |
| Implement ElastiCache for Redis in front of Aurora | ❌ Incorrect | While effective, **requires application changes** to redirect reads to Redis instead of Aurora — violates the "no changes" requirement.                                                                                                                                         |
| Upgrade to Aurora Serverless v2                    | ❌ Incorrect | Aurora Serverless v2 offers elasticity, but **may require app changes** to adapt to new scaling behavior or cluster endpoints.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Migrate to Amazon DynamoDB with DAX                | ❌ Incorrect | This is a **complete data store migration**, requiring major schema and code changes — not compatible with the question constraint.                                                                                                                                             |

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**  
When a question includes:

- **Performance issue**
- **Read-heavy workloads**
- **“No application changes”**

→ Look for **in-place scaling** options like **replica auto-scaling** or cluster enhancements.

**Tip:**  
Caching and schema redesign are great, but they nearly always require **application involvement**.

### 10. Summary Table (Conclusion)

| Insight                                  | Takeaway                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Read replica auto scaling is seamless    | No app changes, dynamic scaling of read capacity  |
| ElastiCache needs read redirection logic | Violates question’s “no app changes” condition    |
| Aurora Serverless is flexible but tricky | Good option, but might impact connection behavior |
| DynamoDB is a complete shift             | Requires redesign, not a drop-in fix              |

---

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **Aurora Read Replica Auto Scaling** automatically adjusts the number of read replicas to match demand using **CloudWatch metrics**.
- Applications can continue using the **cluster endpoint**, and Aurora handles load balancing among the scaled replicas.
- Unlike **ElastiCache**, there’s **no caching logic to manage**, and unlike **Aurora Serverless**, you don’t risk unpredictable warm-up delays or routing complexity.
- Ideal for **read-intensive workloads** where scaling must happen **behind the scenes**, without disrupting existing deployment architecture.

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**

- Look for the **layer of the attack** (e.g., Layer 3/4 = network, Layer 7 = HTTP)
- Match services accordingly:
  - **Shield Advanced** → DDoS protection
  - **WAF** → Web app attack filtering
  - **Firewall Manager** → Policy orchestration
  - **SG/NACL** → Basic stateless filtering

**Tip:**  
Use **Shield Advanced + Firewall Manager + WAF** for layered defense, but **Shield Advanced** is the core for volumetric DDoS mitigation.

| AWS Device Farm                       | ❌ Incorrect | Device Farm is used to **test mobile apps on real devices**, not to **optimize backend latency**.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| DynamoDB Auto Scaling                 | ❌ Incorrect | Auto Scaling adjusts **read/write throughput**, but **doesn’t reduce latency**. It prevents throttling, not delay.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Amazon ElastiCache                    | ❌ Incorrect | ElastiCache provides low-latency access for custom caching, but **doesn’t integrate directly with DynamoDB**. You’d need to manually manage cache consistency.                                                                                                                          |

questionId: "saa-q505"
category: "Design Secure Architectures"
tags: ["saa-c03", "cloudfront", "signed-cookies", "private-content", "s3", "access-control", "cdn"]

---

### Question 'SAA-Q505'

A web application uses **Amazon CloudFront** to distribute **images, videos, and static content** stored in **Amazon S3**.  
Recently, the company introduced **member-only access** for high-quality media.  
The goal is to **restrict access to private content for paying subscribers**, while **preserving existing URLs**.

Which solution best satisfies this requirement?  
**Single answer**

- Create a Signed URL with a custom policy which only allows the members to see the private files.
- Use Signed Cookies to control who can access the private files in your CloudFront distribution by modifying your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content. For members, send the required Set-Cookie headers to the viewer which will unlock the content only to them.
- Configure your CloudFront distribution to use Match Viewer as its Origin Protocol Policy which will automatically match the user request. This will allow access to the private content if the request is a paying member and deny it if it is not a member.
- Configure your CloudFront distribution to use Field-Level Encryption to protect your private data and only allow access to members.

---

### 1. In Simple English

The company wants to **control access** to certain S3 files served through CloudFront — only **subscribers** should be able to view them.  
They want to do this **without changing the URLs** for those media files.

### 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:**

- **Use Signed Cookies to control who can access the private files in your CloudFront distribution...**

| Option                                                                | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Signed Cookies to control who can access the private files...** | ✅ Correct   | Signed cookies **allow access control without modifying the URL**. CloudFront checks the cookie values in viewer requests, making this perfect for **restricting access to multiple resources** behind unchanged URLs. |
| Create a Signed URL with a custom policy                              | ❌ Incorrect | Signed URLs are ideal for **individual files**, but become **impractical for many files**. Also, you must replace URLs with signed versions.                                                                           |
| Configure CloudFront with Match Viewer Origin Protocol Policy         | ❌ Incorrect | This setting **controls protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)** behavior, not access control. It doesn’t restrict content for subscribers.                                                                                             |
| Configure CloudFront to use Field-Level Encryption                    | ❌ Incorrect | This is for **protecting sensitive HTTP form data fields** — not for **controlling access to media files**.                                                                                                            |

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**  
If the question includes:

- **CloudFront + S3**
- **Restrict access**
- **Keep URLs unchanged**
  → Use **Signed Cookies**, not Signed URLs.

**Tip:**  
Use **Signed URLs** when you need to restrict access to **specific individual files**, like downloadable PDFs.  
Use **Signed Cookies** for **groups of files** (e.g., all media in a folder or directory).

### Question 'SAA-Q506'

An application that **records weather data every minute** is deployed using **Spot EC2 instances** and a **MySQL Amazon RDS database**.  
Currently, there is **only one RDS instance** running in **one Availability Zone (AZ)**.

To ensure **high availability**, the company wants to **replicate the database synchronously** to another RDS instance in a different AZ.

Which of the following solutions provides **synchronous data replication** in RDS?  
**Single answer**

- CloudFront running as a Multi-AZ deployment
- RDS Read Replica
- RDS DB instance running as a Multi-AZ deployment
- DynamoDB Read Replica

---

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**  
When you see **RDS + High Availability**, always consider:

- Use **Multi-AZ** for synchronous, automated failover
- Use **Read Replicas** for read scaling (not for HA)

**Tip:**  
If the keyword is **"synchronous replication"** → it's **Multi-AZ**.  
If the keyword is **"read performance"** or **"replication lag"** → it's **Read Replica**.

---

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- **RDS Multi-AZ** automatically provisions a **standby replica** in another Availability Zone and performs **synchronous replication**.
- In case of a **failure (e.g., AZ outage)**, RDS **automatically fails over** to the standby with minimal downtime.
- **RDS Read Replicas** support read scaling but require **manual promotion** and are **eventually consistent**.
- You can convert a single-AZ RDS instance to Multi-AZ with **zero application change** by enabling the setting.

### Question 'SAA-Q508'

A tech company has a **CRM application** hosted on an **Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances**.  
Users mostly access it during **office hours (9 AM to 5 PM)**.  
They've reported **slow performance at the start of the day**, which improves later.

What can be done to ensure **smooth performance right from the beginning** of the workday?  
**Single answer**

- Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization.
- Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to your architecture to ensure that the traffic is properly distributed on the instances.
- Configure a Scheduled scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day.
- Configure a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization.

---

### 1. In Simple English

The app runs on EC2 and gets busy at **9 AM** when users start work.  
But the system **scales reactively**, so performance is bad for the first hour.  
How can you **pre-scale** EC2 capacity so the app runs well from the very beginning?

| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dynamic scaling based on memory utilization       | ❌ Incorrect | Auto Scaling doesn’t **natively support memory utilization** as a metric without custom CloudWatch setup. Not ideal for this scenario. |
| ALB to distribute traffic                         | ❌ Incorrect | ALBs **distribute load**, but they can’t **create EC2 capacity** or solve under-provisioning.                                          |
| **Scheduled scaling before the start of the day** | ✅ Correct   | Scheduled scaling **launches EC2 instances in advance**, so the application is ready for known peak times (like 9 AM).                 |
| Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization          | ❌ Incorrect | Dynamic scaling only kicks in **after traffic spikes**, causing delays — this is the exact problem reported.                           |

### Question 'SAA-Q509'

An **online shopping platform** runs on **Spot EC2 instances** with **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL** as its database.  
You need to:

- Send **production write traffic** to **high-capacity instances**
- Route **reporting queries** to **low-capacity replicas**

What is the **best configuration** to achieve this?  
**Single answer**

- In your application, use the instance endpoint of your Aurora database to handle the incoming production traffic and use the cluster endpoint to handle reporting queries.
- Create a custom endpoint in Aurora based on the specified criteria for the production traffic and another custom endpoint to handle the reporting queries.
- Do nothing since by default, Aurora will automatically direct the production traffic to your high-capacity instances and the reporting queries to your low-capacity instances.
- Configure your application to use the reader endpoint for both production traffic and reporting queries, which will enable your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas.

---

### 1. In Simple English

You want to **separate write and reporting traffic** in Aurora PostgreSQL, so **heavy writes go to powerful instances** and **read-only reports go to lightweight replicas**.  
How do you control that routing?

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Realism of scenario | ✅ High — separating workloads is standard in production databases |
| Clarity of wording  | ⚠️ Moderate — could be confusing due to endpoint types             |
| Practical relevance | ✅ Essential for workload isolation and cost optimization          |

### 4. Answer and Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer:**

- **Create a custom endpoint in Aurora based on the specified criteria for the production traffic and another custom endpoint to handle the reporting queries.**

| Option                                                                          | Verdict      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use **instance endpoint** for production and **cluster endpoint** for reporting | ❌ Incorrect | Instance endpoints are for direct connection to a **single node**, not load-balanced routing. Cluster endpoint routes only to the **writer**.                                      |
| **Custom endpoints for traffic separation**                                     | ✅ Correct   | Aurora custom endpoints allow routing based on **user-defined criteria**, like pointing production writes to high-capacity instances and reporting reads to low-capacity replicas. |
| Do nothing — Aurora auto-directs traffic                                        | ❌ Incorrect | Aurora doesn’t auto-route based on **instance capacity**; traffic must be **explicitly routed**.                                                                                   |
| Use **reader endpoint** for all traffic                                         | ❌ Incorrect | Reader endpoints load-balance across **replicas only** — but **write traffic must go to the writer node**.                                                                         |

### 8. How to Approach Similar Questions

**Strategy:**  
Know the **Aurora endpoint types**:

- **Cluster endpoint** → Always points to **writer**
- **Reader endpoint** → Load balances across **read-only replicas**
- **Custom endpoint** → You choose which instances (reader/writer) handle the traffic

**Tip:**  
Use **custom endpoints** to **separate reads/writes** and align each with **appropriate hardware**.

---

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- Aurora **Custom Endpoints** allow advanced **query routing** by assigning a specific group of Aurora Replicas to serve traffic from that endpoint.
- This enables teams to separate **analytical workloads** from **transactional ones**, preventing reporting jobs from impacting production performance.
- You can use this to point **low-latency writes** to **high-memory writer nodes**, while sending **long-running reports** to **lower-tier replicas**.
- You can modify which instances are included in the custom endpoint **without downtime**.

### Question 'SAA-Q510'

A **Dockerized application** running on **Amazon ECS** behind a load balancer is making **heavy use of DynamoDB**.  
You are asked to **distribute the database workload evenly** and make better use of **provisioned throughput**.

What should you change in your DynamoDB table configuration?  
**Single answer**

- Use partition keys with low-cardinality attributes, which have a few number of distinct values for each item.
- Reduce the number of partition keys in the DynamoDB table.
- Use partition keys with high-cardinality attributes, which have a large number of distinct values for each item.
- Avoid using a composite primary key, which is composed of a partition key and a sort key.

### 11. Concept Expansion / Key Facts

- DynamoDB stores items across **partitions**, and the **partition key** determines which partition handles each item.
- Using a **high-cardinality partition key** ensures even workload distribution across **physical partitions**, preventing any single partition from being overloaded.
- This is especially important for **provisioned throughput** tables, where each partition has its own throughput quota.
- **Hot partition problems** can cause throttling, increased latency, and failed writes.
